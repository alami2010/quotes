What he told me was just one sentence, but I cannot describe the bliss I attained from holding onto that one simple sentence. Through that one sentence I attained a peace and a happiness that can never be explained in words\u0027.",

You challenge them by repeatedly asking yourself \\Who am I? Who is the person who is having these thoughts?\\ If the challenge is to be effective you must make it before the rising thought has had a chance to develop into a stream of thoughts. Mind is only a collection of thoughts and the thinker who thinks them. The thinker is the \u0027I-thought\u0027, the primal thought which rises from the Self before all others, which identifies with all other thoughts and says, \u0027I am this body\u0027. When you have eradicated all thoughts except for the thinker himself by ceaseless enquiry or by refusing to give them any attention, the \u0027I-thought\u0027 sinks into the Heart and surrenders, leaving behind it only an awareness of consciousness. This surrender will only take place when the \u0027I-thought\u0027 has ceased to identify with rising thoughts. While there are still stray thoughts which attract or evade your attention, the \u0027I-thought\u0027 will always be directing its attention outwards rather than inwards. The purpose of self-enquiry is to make the \u0027I-thought\u0027 move inwards, towards the Self. This will happen automatically as soon as you cease to be interested in any of your rising thoughts.",
