Then comes awareness, the direct insight into the whole of consciousness, the totality of the mind. The mind is like a river, flowing ceaselessly in the bed of the body, you identify yourself for a moment with some particular ripple and call it \u0027my thought\u0027. All you are conscious of is your mind. Awareness is the cognizance of consciousness as a whole.",

    "quotes": "In meditation there are eight depths of absorption before coming to samadhi, each levels of going deeper and deeper inwards towards your true nature. As the mind gradually comes to a stillness, you will experience various states of consciousness - so when I was involved in my inner work towards awakening, once I got the hang of the flavor of meditation, to experience shifts in perception on a daily basis was an ordinary thing, but it was not always a pleasant experience. There are certain \u0027hellish\u0027 levels of the unconscious, where if you enter into them, you will have to confront all of your demons which are none other than the desires of the ego which are creating suffering for you and have been creating suffering for ages. So before I could enter beyond those levels, I had to cultivate this quality of being able to remain a witnessing awareness without clinging to whatever might happen in my experience, whether pleasurable or unpleasurable. In fact, this is the whole key of meditation - to observe without clinging to the objects of your perception, just watching like a clear mirror which is without prejudice. I had discovered that this same key remains the same throughout every depth of meditation, it is like a master key. But there comes a point where even this becomes destroyed - and you enter into no-mind. Effort was useful for me at a point, but beyond all effort disappears and a far more natural, spontaneous intelligence comes in its place which is not a result of effort. Silence is never an effort of the mind, but without an effort of the mind I discovered that one cannot prepare the space for silence.",

The ending of the self with its desires and fears enables you to return to your real nature, the source of all happiness and peace. The perennial desire for pleasure is the reflection of the timeless harmony within. It is an observable fact that one becomes self-conscious only when caught in the conflict between pleasure and pain, which demands choice and decision. It is this clash between desire and fear that causes anger, which is the great destroyer of sanity in life. When pain is accepted for what it is, a lesson and a warning, and deeply looked into and heeded, the separation between pain and pleasure breaks down, both become experience - painful when resisted, joyful when accepted.",

Awareness, being lucid harmony (sattva) in action, dissolves dullness and quietens the restlessness of the mind and gently, but steadily changes its very substance.

Whether it is the thought of Jesus, Buddha, X, Y, or Z, it is still thought, and therefore one thought can be in opposition to another thought; and when there is opposition, a conflict between two thoughts, the result is a modified continuity of thought. In other words, the change is still within the field of thought, and change within the field of thought is no change at all. One idea or set of ideas has merely been substituted for another. Seeing this whole process, is it possible to leave thought and bring about a change outside the field of thought? All consciousness, surely, whether it is of the past, the present, or the future, is within the field of thought; and any change within that field, which sets the boundaries of the mind, is no real change. A radical change can take place only outside the field of thought, not within it, and the mind can leave the field only when it sees the confines, the boundaries of the field, and realizes that any change within the field is no change at all.

    "quotes": "In true meditation the emphasis is on being awareness, not on being aware of objects, but on resting as primordial awareness itself. Primordial awareness (consciousness) is the source in which all objects arise and subside. As you gently relax into awareness, into listening, the mind\u0027s compulsive contraction around objects will fade. Silence of being will come more clearly into consciousness as a welcoming to rest and abide. An attitude of open receptivity, free of any goal or anticipation, will facilitate the presence of silence and stillness to be revealed as your natural condition. Silence and stillness are not states and therefore cannot be produced or created. Silence is the non-state in which all states arise and subside. Silence, stillness and awareness are not states and can never be perceived in their totality as objects. Silence is itself the eternal witness without form or attributes. As you rest more profoundly as the witness, all objects take on their natural functionality, and awareness becomes free of the mind\u0027s compulsive contractions and identifications. It returns to its natural non-state of Presence.",

    "quotes": "We are all living in a \u0027thought sphere\u0027. Your thoughts are not your own; they belong to everybody. There are only thoughts, but you create a counter-thought, the thinker, with which you read every thought. Your effort to control life has created a secondary movement of thought within you, which you call the \u0027I\u0027. This movement of thought within you is parallel to the movement of life, but isolated from it; it can never touch life. You are a living creature, yet you lead your entire life within the realm of this isolated, parallel movement of thought. You cut yourself off from life - that is something very unnatural. The natural state is not a \u0027thoughtless state\u0027 - that is one of the greatest hoaxes perpetrated for thousands of years on poor, helpless Hindus. You will never be without thought until the body is a corpse, a very dead corpse. Being able to think is necessary to survive. But in this state thought stops choking you; it falls into its natural rhythm. There is no longer a \u0027you\u0027 who reads the thoughts and thinks that they are \u0027his\u0027. Have you ever looked at that parallel movement of thought? The books on English grammar will tell you that \u0027I\u0027 is a first person singular pronoun, subjective case; but that is not what you want to know. Can you look at that thing you call \u0027I\u0027? It is very elusive. Look at it now, feel it, touch it, and tell me. How do you look at it? And what is the thing that is looking at what you call \u0027I\u0027? This is the crux of the whole problem: the one that is looking at what you call \u0027I\u0027 is the \u0027I\u0027. It is creating an illusory division of itself into subject and object, and through this division it is continuing. This is the divisive nature that is operating in you, in your consciousness. Continuity of its existence is all that interests it. As long as you want to understand that \u0027you\u0027 or to change that \u0027you\u0027 into something spiritual, into something holy, beautiful or marvelous, that \u0027you\u0027 will continue. If you do not want to do anything about it, it is not there, it\u0027s gone. How do you understand this? I have for all practical purposes made a statement: \u0027What you are looking at is not different from the one who is looking\u0027. What do you do with a statement like this? What instrument do you have at your disposal for understanding a meaningless, illogical, irrational statement? You begin to think. Through thinking, you cannot understand a thing. You are translating what I am saying, in terms of the knowledge you already have, just as you translate everything else, because you want to get something out of it. When you stop doing that, what is there is what I am describing. The absence of what you are doing - trying to understand, or trying to change yourself - is the state of being that I am describing.",

Though for some people this may come very easily, I also notice that many of these people are no freer than anyone else. If you don\u0027t believe that the ego can exist in very advanced states of consciousness, think again. The point isn\u0027t the state of consciousness, even very advanced ones, but an awake mystery that is the source of all states of consciousness. It is even the source of presence and beingness. It is beyond all perception and all experience. I call it \u0027awakeness\u0027. To find out that you are empty of emptiness is to die into an aware mystery, which is the source of all existence. It just so happens that that mystery is in love with all of its manifestation and non-manifestation. You find your Self by stepping back out of yourself.",

It is much, much less. Many mistake the intoxicating power of otherworldly charisma for enlightenment. More often than not it is simply otherworldly, and not necessarily free or enlightened. In order to be truly free, you must desire to know the truth more than you want to feel good. Because if feeling good is your goal, then as soon as you feel better you will lose interest in what is true. This does not mean that feeling good or experiencing love and bliss is a bad thing. Given the choice, anyone would choose to feel bliss rather than sorrow. It simply means that if this desire to feel good is stronger than the yearning to see, know, and experience Truth, then this desire will always be distorting the perception of what is Real, while corrupting one\u0027s deepest integrity.",

I am neither conscious nor unconscious, I am beyond the mind and its various states and conditions. Distinctions are created by the mind and apply to the mind only. I am pure Consciousness itself, unbroken awareness of all that is. I am in a more real state than yours. I am undistracted by the distinctions and separations which constitute a person. As long as the body lasts, it has its needs like any other, but my mental process has come to an end. My thinking, like my digestion, is unconscious and purposeful. I am not a person in your sense of the word, though I may appear a person to you. I am that infinite ocean of consciousness in which all happens. I am also beyond all existence and cognition, pure bliss of being. There is nothing I feel separate from, hence I am all. No thing is me, so I am nothing. Life will escape, the body will die, but it will not affect me in the least. Beyond space and time I am, uncaused, uncausing, yet the very matrix of existence.",

    "quotes": "All inquiry is meant for one purpose: to take you experientially into the Unknown as efficiently as possible. Once you get there, simply be still because the inquiry has delivered you to its destination. The rest is up to Grace. Do not hold onto any knowledge that comes your way. Even the greatest revelations must not be clung to, or you will end up with a head full of memories and a heart empty of substance. The truth is ever new, existing only in the now. The highest truth is beyond knowledge and experience. It is beyond time and space, and beyond beingness, consciousness, and oneness. Just remember that all direct path techniques are meant simply to undermine, to cut away, the one who is performing them. No matter what spiritual path you\u0027ve walked or what teachings you\u0027ve followed, they must lead you back to no path and no teaching. A true teaching is like a blazing fire that consumes itself. The teaching must not only consume you, but consume itself as well. All must be burned to ash, and then the ash must be burned. Then, and only then, is the Ultimate realized. True Enlightenment destroys enlightenment. As long as you can refer back to yourself and say, \u0027I\u0027m enlightened\u0027, you\u0027re not. Enlightenment is authentic only when there is no one left to be enlightened. Even to say \u0027I am nobody\u0027, is one too many. There\u0027s a point when you intuitively realize that to be Free you have to give up your attachment to Freedom. You have to quit asking yourself: Is it still there? Am I okay? You have to decide to never look over your shoulder again to see if you\u0027re free or if others know you\u0027re free. You just have to let yourself burn there - no matter what. This isn\u0027t something I can help you with. I can tell you what you need to do, but you have to do it. In the beginning, teachers can help a lot. But the deeper you go, all they can do is point, and clarify, and tell you what you need to do. Only you can take this step. Nobody can push you into this place.",

Watch the sense \u0027I am\u0027, find out your real self\u0027. I obeyed him, because I trusted him. I did as he told me. All my spare time I would spend looking at myself in silence. And what a difference it made, and how soon. It took me only three years to realize my true nature. My Guru died soon after I met him, but it made no difference. I remembered what he told me and persevered. The fruit of it is here with me.",

He would also say: \\Go straight ahead!\\, meaning don\u0027t constantly try to figure things out with your mind even including the correct practice. But so many of you who read this are trying to figure things out with your mind. You ask: \\What is the best practice? Am I doing this right? What about what Ramana said one time? Nisargadatta said this at one time, what do you think about that?\\ Your mind is always stopping you from getting deeper than mind. You are deeper than your mind and even deeper than consciousness, but until you stop following the lead of your mind, you will never get below mind, you will never find freedom. I did all that self-doubt, self-checking, got distracted, worried about making money, employment, played endlessly with philosophical and spiritual concepts, and just plain dawdled for 27 years. I could have done it in half the time if I hadn\u0027t \u0027wobbled\u0027 so much. Therefore, based on my own experience, I urge you to stop thinking. Just get hold of the Nisargadatta Gita, download it, print it out and read it every morning and evening. Then sit and ponder the meaning. Then sit as strongly as possible, find the \u0027I Am\u0027 feeling, and dwell in it, abide in it, immerse your attention in it. If you do it strongly and continuously, in a very short time you will begin to feel happy, and all your questions will begin to go away. Just go straight ahead with that practice. It is a matter of persistence and focus. All the experiences you have along the way are irrelevant, meaningless distractions. Just follow the deepening peace, the deepening \u0027I Am\u0027 until the \u0027I Am\u0027 disappears. This is when \u0027self-discovery\u0027 becomes really, really interesting.

Let me ask you: \\What does it matter?\\ Does having one extra bit of knowledge about where you are help you are all to go beyond all understanding to freedom and total emptiness? No, it just keeps you trapped in the cognitive mind that is trying to figure everything out, putting everything into a conceptual pigeonhole. But satisfying the mind\u0027s need to understand and know completely blocks going beyond the mind and that particular experience you are questioning! Do have come to a dead stop with no more movement possible until you let go of the question and the experience. You can\u0027t get to freedom through conceptual understanding. You have to lose your mind entirely by doing non conceptual things, like abiding in the sense of I Am until the mind and body disappear. This is the first glint of freedom. Eventually even this will drop away, but you need to stop depending on mind. Instead you need to trust the method of self-inquiry, more properly described as abiding in the I-sense. No experience you have on the way is worth talking about. When the big experiences come, they are self-explanatory and need no one to interpret or check progress.  Towards this state of certainty is where you should be aiming, and that is by just submerging in the \u0027I Am\u0027, or \u0027I-sense\u0027. All the rest is conceptual nonsense. Be courageous. Go without words, questioning. Just keep looking at the I or the \u0027I-sense\u0027. Then feel it with your heart.

    "quotes": "Mind is not a thing. It is a process of minding, thinking. Its basic nature is to fragment the consciousness. Mind is a like a crowd of politicians giving many self contradictory speeches at the same time. This crowd in the mind is not a fixed crowd but a changing crowd. Thought is an acquired process. It is not our innate nature. That is why there are no thoughts in deep sleep state. Thoughts of belonging to a family, race, nationality, religion, profession, caste, creed, cult etc are just utilitarian in nature. Mind is a by-product of upbringing, conditioning, education, culture. Basically mind is an acquisition of habits and identifying with them and then think we are that stuff. If mind is in a state of thinking, consciousness in it becomes opaque, non-transparent, just like on a cloudy day, you cannot see the blue sky. When the clouds are not, you can see the sky. If we carefully observe we will come to know that when one thought passes and before another thought is yet to come there is an interval. That is the sky of consciousness. In that interval, in that gap you can feel the natural state of our witnessing consciousness. But for many thoughts are so speedy that they cannot feel the gap between one thought and the another. In Self-inquiry thought process is slowed down and we begin to feel the gaps. So in Self-inquiry there is a fight for our innate nature of witnessing consciousness against our mental habits. Self-inquiry helps us to put aside the mental habits. It helps us that which is natural to us, real \u0027I\u0027. Thinking belongs to the mind and witnessing is our innate nature. So we cannot do both simultaneously. Thinking must cease for the witnessing consciousness to be. Only through witnessing we reach the reality. Self-inquiry cannot have a fixed path for investigation. It is just like driving a car in a busy city during rush hour and we have to find the gaps to drive the car. Similarly in Self-inquiry we have to be alert to find the gaps between thoughts and in the interval between when mind changes from one mode to another during transitional state. Only then \u0027being\u0027 can happen through witnessing. We cannot both sit and run with our legs at same time. Similarly we cannot think and witness at same time simultaneously. That is the art of Self-inquiry. We don\u0027t run after our thoughts but we sit safely in the source of being which is our Self.",

    "quotes": "The practice is to turn inward towards the source, the looker, and look for it. Ultimately you will understand - see, experience, apprehend, discover, know - that there is no looking inside or outside. There is just one consciousness. The intentional effort of looking within was to counterbalance a lifelong habit of looking outwards and to develop introspective discrimination to eliminate internal and external objects and phenomena as the true you. I want to emphasize that the phrase \u0027look inward\u0027 is a lie. There is no inward or outward. This distinction only lasts while you think you are a body. The phrase \u0027look inward\u0027 almost sounds like a command to look into the inner emptiness of imagination, as inside the body. It is a bad instruction. It reinforces the idea of the reality of inner and outer, inside the skin and outside. The world, your inner state, your searching, your imagination about what self-realization is like, will all disappear and you will understand that everything you have experienced until that moment is imagination. You will be free of all concept and imagination. In this you must abide for a long while, but self-abidance itself does not become continuous for a long time. It is a matter of persistence alone, and that only arises after a sustaining passion for truth becomes the most important issue to you. Then, at some point, \u0027everything\u0027 will disappear as unreal and you will be left in silent mind existence.",

This reflex takes the shape of \u0027I\u0027 and uses the body and the mind for its purposes, which are invariably in search for pleasure or flight from pain. When you recognize the \u0027I\u0027 as it is, a bundle of desires and fears, and the sense of \u0027mine\u0027 as embracing all things and people needed for the purpose of avoiding pain and securing pleasure, you will see that the \u0027I\u0027 and the \u0027mine\u0027 are false ideas, having no foundation in reality. Created by the mind, they rule their creator as long as it takes them to be true; when questioned, they dissolve.

If you carefully examine such evidence, you will soon convince yourself beyond the shadow of a doubt that it doesn\u0027t support at all the limited or confined consciousness theory. That will leave you in a state of not knowing who you are. Abide in this state until you notice that you have again begun to think, feel, perceive, or act from the perspective of being a limited consciousness. At this point, resume the same investigation, which should be much shorter this time, and lead to the same state of not knowing. Abide in this state for as long as it lasts. And so on, and so on. At some point, as you stabilize in this state of not knowing, the light of your own presence, the \u0027I-I\u0027 of which Ramana Maharshi speaks in his talks, will reveal itself in his limitlessness and immortality, beyond all doubts.

As long as the observer, the inner self, the higher self, considers himself apart from the observed, the lower self, despises it and condemns it, the situation is hopeless. It is only when the observer (vyakta) accepts the person (vyakti) as a projection or manifestation of himself and, so to say, takes the self into the Self, the duality of \u0027I\u0027 and \u0027this\u0027 goes, and in the identity of the outer and the inner the Supreme Reality manifests itself. This union of the seer and the seen happens when the seer becomes conscious of himself as the seer; he is not merely interested in the seen, which he is anyhow, but also interested in being interested, giving attention to attention, aware of being aware. Affectionate awareness is the crucial factor that brings Reality into focus. When the vyakti realizes its non-existence in separation from the vyakta, and the vyakta sees the vyakti as his own expression, then the peace and silence of the avyakta state come into being. In reality the three are one: the vyakta and the avyakta are inseparable, while the vyakti is the sensing-feeling-thinking process.",

    "quotes": "The dream self is created from identification with objects that arise. For example, you might think: \\I am angry\\, or \\It\u0027s a dreadful day\\. But look more closely. If you can see a thought, is that thought you? If you can see an emotion, is it you? You are the seer, not the objects seen. That which is seen is an object that arises and falls - a temporary form. You are that which is looking at those objects as they arise and fall. Even the notion that there is a seer as a separate identity is an object (an idea) in awareness. In looking inward, there is no separate entity there. There is only awareness recognizing awareness. Awareness is not an object. Your true identity is pure seeing itself. This can be fearful if there is a desire to hold onto some identity. But it is absolutely liberating if you see that even that fear is an object in awareness. Suffering happens when you believe that you are your thoughts and emotions. In reality, you are not angry. Anger is arising. It\u0027s not actually a dreadful day. The thought: \\It\u0027s a dreadful day\\ is arising in awareness. This is not about denying or suppressing thought and emotion. It is about seeing them for what they really are.",

In this little space the mind seeks freedom, and so it is always a prisoner of itself. Meditation is the ending of this little space. To us, action is bringing about order in this little space of the mind. But there is another action which is not putting order in this little space. Meditation is action which comes when the mind has lost its little space. This vast space which the mind, the \u0027I\u0027, cannot reach, is silence. The mind can never be silent within itself; it is silent only within the vast space which thought cannot touch. Out of this silence there is action which is not of thought.

So when you listen to a thought, you are aware not only of the thought but also of yourself as the witness of the thought. A new dimension of consciousness has come in. As you listen to the thought, you feel a conscious presence - your deeper self - behind or underneath the thought, as it were. The thought then loses its power over you and quickly subsides, because you are no longer energizing the mind through identification with it. As you go more deeply into this realm of no-mind, as it is sometimes called in the East, you realize the state of pure consciousness. In that state, you feel your own presence with such intensity and such joy that all thinking, all emotions, your physical body, as well as the whole external world become relatively insignificant in comparison to it. And yet this is not a selfish but a selfless state. It takes you beyond what you previously thought of as \u0027your self\u0027.",

It is presence itself. It is that simple. Anything we think, hear, see, touch, taste, smell, or experience is an appearance of or movement within awareness. Awareness is the unchanging, unmoving space of the present moment. It is inseparable from what you are. It is the only aspect of your existence that has never come and gone. When you were twelve years old, twenty years old, and thirty years old, different thoughts, emotions, states, sensations, and experiences moved through this awareness.

It sits on your shoulders like a hundred pound weight telling you life is not the way it is supposed to be until the toilet is fixed and then the stress will go away. And then the plumber says \\I can\u0027t come until next Wednesday\\ and that hurts because you know you will have to carry around that thought, that conflict of \\I have to get the toilet fixed\\ for another week. And there are thousands of them arising so fas! Toilet fixed, doctor appointment, not enough money, your lover dumped you, you hate your job. You wake up in the morning from a state of deep peace and freedom from all identity and boom! The mind looks for something to identify with and there\u0027s the broken toilet, the doctor appointment, the empty space next to you that your lover used to fill, you hate your job, and you do not want to go to work. Thousands of others arise within seconds. And that\u0027s who you think you are, that is how you perceive life. Sure you get the good thoughts too but then that creates conflict and stress. You want one thought over the other; one experience over the other. And so the remedy is not to try and have one thought over the other, but to stop the identification with thinking all together, after all, it\u0027s all phenomena. Whether through witnessing thoughts or placing your attention on what is here beyond thinking, it is to break that addiction of identifying with thoughts and rest as your natural state of being. To stop allowing thoughts to dictate your experience and instead discover what is truly here beyond the thinking. It is to realize your natural state. Because your natural state is love, your natural state is peace, your natural state is free of all of this, all of this. Do you realize that your natural state, your birthright, is not some superficial emotional experience but one that every cell is vibrating with in a changeless state of love and peace - a state beyond what mind could possibly comprehend? And if you can taste that once, for one tiny instant, then you can do it twice. Then you can rest in your natural state for longer periods of time before being pulled back into thinking. And eventually, the duality between thoughts and peace ceases to exist. You begin to experience thoughts as energy. It\u0027s like you stop being involved with the lyrics to the song and simply enjoy the music, the simple beautiful joy of the music. The toilet still needs to be fixed but you\u0027re no longer wearing the toilet as if it were a hat. It no longer defines you. You exist completely free of all of it as unconditioned and unconditional changeless beautiful peace.",

    "quotes": "Turn your attention away from the dream right now. Just for right now, you don\u0027t need it. Let the thoughts and worries of the dream character continue as they will, but just step back for a moment and watch it happen, watch the dream character involved in its dream. And while the dream character is going about its business, turn your attention to the one thing right now that is shining and clear, peaceful and unassuming, steady and solid: the consciousness with which the dream character is being observed. Just rest here, in the unchanging consciousness which reflects but is not changed by what it reflects. This is reality. Nothing else is. Rest your attention here. Get to know it. Let the reality of consciousness be known to you, as you. Nothing needs to be done here. No thought affects it, and so thought is not needed. No action affects it, and so action is not needed. It\u0027s not possible to do anything with this consciousness because this consciousness is everything already. Pay attention to it for a moment right now and it is easily noticed that consciousness is complete. And since consciousness is complete, you are complete. The only thing that ever makes you feel like you are not complete, not whole, and that you need to \u0027return\u0027 somewhere to find wholeness, is that you have put your attention into the dream life, and forgotten that wholeness is all that you really are. So observe the dream character as it desires enlightenment, and as it desires love, reassurance, respect. Watch the dream character as its life plays out. It is not who you are. You are this consciousness, which has no mortality, no vulnerability, and no limits. Beyond all imagination, the nothingness within which resides the seed of all existence, the shining creation of infinite universes - this is you. Put your attention here, and allow your sense of this to grow. If you are looking for Wholeness, here it is. If you are looking for True Love, here it is, in the One Unlimited Self that is Reality. No other love is possible. And this Love is already here, as You.",

    "quotes": "In non-objective meditation, our attention is drawn towards the non-objective, the ultimate subject, consciousness. This is accomplished as a result of understanding. At the first stage, the truth-seeker is asked to notice that the happiness he is really looking for is non-objective, which means \u0027not contained in any object, gross or subtle\u0027. When this is understood, he is then asked to realize that the mind, which can only grasp mentations (thoughts and sense-perceptions), cannot have access to the non-objective realm. It follows that any attempt to secure the happiness he is looking for through the mind is bound to failure. When this is understood, the mind soon finds itself in a natural state of stillness. In this natural form of meditation, sensations or thoughts are neither sought nor avoided; they are simply welcomed and seen off. It could be described as a total openness, in which we are totally open to our sense perceptions, our bodily sensations, our emotions, our feelings and our thoughts. We could compare these mentations with the various characters of a play. As long as we find the play interesting, our attention is completely drawn by the actors on the foreground, but, if there is a weak moment, our attention progressively relaxes until we become suddenly aware of the background, of the stage. In the same way, as our attention becomes global, unfocused, open, disinterested, (and this detachment follows from our understanding that these mentations have really nothing to offer in terms of real happiness), our attention relaxes, until we become suddenly aware of the background, consciousness, which reveals itself as the ultimate immortality, splendor and happiness we were looking for. It is not necessary for the actors to leave the stage in order for us to be aware of the background of the stage; similarly, the absence of mentations is not a prerequisite for awareness of the Self. However, in the same way as, when the actors leave and our attention relaxes, we have an opportunity to become aware of the background, there is an opportunity to \u0027visualize\u0027 our real nature when a mentation merges into consciousness.",

It is right to say \u0027I am\u0027, but to say \u0027I am this\u0027, \u0027I am that\u0027 is a sign of not enquiring, not examining, of mental weakness or lethargy.

A ray of awareness illumines a part of our mind and that part becomes our dream or waking consciousness, while awareness appears as the witness. The witness usually knows only consciousness. Sadhana consists in the witness turning back first on his conscious, then upon himself in his own awareness. Self-awareness is Yoga.",

Nothing manifesting as a world, as everything there is and is not. And there is only the Tao, which is to say there is no Tao at all. And even to speak of it, even to think of it, even to do that is to lose it forever. And yet the thinking and the speaking are fully the Tao; there is nothing that it is not. It is the no-thing by which everything appears. And it\u0027s not even that, because it\u0027s not an \u0027it\u0027 at all. When speaking of the Tao, silence is the only way.",

But when you see there is only consciousness, the whole story falls apart. There is no one to get enlightened, and there was never anyone suffering. It was happening in the story, as a story. So this is why many say: \\No one gets enlightened\\. And also, at the same time, you see there was never anyone suffering. All your stories get thrown away. All there is, is consciousness and the stories that are playing in your head-stories of a suffering person, stories of an enlightened person, or stories of an awakened person who must embody his awakening. They are all stories and none of them are true. The only truth is \u0027I Am\u0027, this consciousness is, and you\u0027re done. There is nothing else. There are no levels of attainment. No levels of embodiment. There is no one to embody anything. That is all conceptual nonsense. Believing in that conceptual nonsense is delusional and creates more suffering for yourself!

The self, which is like a time-bound, thought-based story, believes that thought provides the answer to everything. It is only natural to look, then, in thought for presence. But it isn\u0027t there. Thought is appearing and disappearing in presence. So the one who would go looking into some concept for presence is, itself, a concept. Instead of looking to the next concept, what is it that sees the concept? In that seeing, the recognition of awareness is available. That is awareness, shining effortlessly, in that moment of noticing a thought. That which sees the thought is already awareness. In the next moment, there may be a tendency to go back into thought again, but what is it that sees that next thought? It isn\u0027t a different awareness.

See that it is the only thing that you can never argue or be confused about. This space of awareness is simply here and awake. The thought \\I get it\\, and \\I dont get it\\ are equal appearances of this space. This space does not require any mental understanding to recognize itself. Mental understanding can provide a conceptual framework. But all thinking happens within this space. This space is what sees these words right now. It is that simple. Stick with that basic fact.

You create the world and then worry about it. Becoming selfish makes you weak. If you think you have the strength and courage to desire, it is because you are young and inexperienced. Invariably the object of desire destroys the means of acquiring it and then itself withers away. It is all for the best, because it teaches you to shun desire like poison. No need of any acts of renunciation. Just turn your mind away, that is all. Desire is merely the fixation of the mind on an idea. Get it out of its groove by denying it attention.

Go back to your attempts till the brushing away of every desire and fear, of every reaction, becomes automatic.",

As we turn our attention towards our own Being, this very one, the apparent entity who seemed to turn his attention, is revealed to be none other than Presence itself. And two, taking our stand as this aware presence, we can cooperate with the realignment of the mind and the body, and indeed the world, with this new stance. It just requires patience, clarity and courage. Presence has seemed to veil itself from itself by taking the shape of dualistic thought. But being the very substance of all experience, Presence has also provided within every experience, the way back to itself, a golden thread... the way of investigation and contemplation. From the point of view of a person these two possibilities will inevitably feel like a doing - so be it. They are Presence\u0027s gift of grace to itself.",

    "quotes": "A breakthrough in meditation is happening when you enjoy being who you are, enjoying it unconditionally. Once the mind enters, the fragrance of sitting in meditation becomes will power: \\I will succeed to reach higher\\, \\I will prove that I can find it\\, \\I will achieve what I came here to do\\. So we can sit in meditative posture full with will power and discipline, but this will simply be another act, another doing. Meditation is not a doing. Meditation is resting in that space of simply being yourself, not trying to achieve it and not waiting for something to release you out of it. Resting in that which you are already is meditation! Usually that is overlooked because there is an idea hiding in the unconscious. An idea of what this moment \u0027should\u0027 be like, what I \u0027want\u0027, what I\u0027m \u0027afraid of\u0027, ideas. Meditation happens when you sit in the theater of the mind and suddenly, no matter what movie is projected on the screen - boring, scary, a drama, a thriller - all of a sudden you lose interest in the movie. You have simply watched it too many times. Without an effort comes a mysterious pull within you to move inwards and to rest, awakened rest in the silence of your being. It is a peaceful rest in a state of being in which we don\u0027t need to gain any fulfillment, without a need for stimulation of the senses and without the need to chase after our dreams. You can look at this as your natural willingness to be who you are, unconditionally, totally, without any effort to go somewhere, without any need to accomplish something, without any wish to chase after anything. You rest in that which you are and you are totally present, in the Here and Now. Discover that flame within you, and suddenly the waiting for the gong that ends the meditation is no longer there. This is the timeless moment of meditation. It is timeless, because you are not waiting for it to finish. When expansion of consciousness is happening, it is a state of grace not of will power. If you stay with will power, the waiting for the gong will always be there, ticking: \\A little while longer and I\u0027ll have a break\\, \\A little while longer and the meditation is over\\. But you are not in a prison. Awakening is a state of being that reveals when your realization is opening to see how liberated you are, how joyful it is to dissolve into this moment and to be totally present. Not by doing something, but with expansion of consciousness; beyond dreams, fantasies, expectations. Rather than waiting for the meditation to finish, find the crack in that body/mind mechanism. The crack that leads you - even if just for a single moment but a moment that becomes eternity - the crack that leads you to total peace, resting in the now where you are not doing meditation, but when you are being meditation itself.",

You want to become empty. Yet most people seem to go to different teachers, read many books, and they add on. They keep adding, adding, adding, adding, adding.

He took off all his clothes and stood naked in the street and it started to rain and he shaved his head. I\u0027m not referring to that, you do not have to do this. But what you have to do is to empty your mind. You have to empty your mind of all thoughts. It\u0027s not that hard, really. How do you do this? You simply observe your thoughts. You watch your thoughts. You become mindful of every act you perform. From the moment you get out of bed in the morning, you become mindful of what you\u0027re doing.",

The attempt to destroy the ego or the mind by methods other than Self-enquiry is like a thief turning policeman to catch the thief that is himself.

But in this method the final question is the only one and is raised from the very beginning.

To abide in your natural state requires no movement or doing on your part. People ask \\what can I do to bring my awareness to the natural state?\\ The key is in realising that if you didn\u0027t do anything, your awareness would not have left it in the first place this morning.",

Relax in the knowledge that there is a natural state that you may consciously return and sink your attention into during the day when you observe that you are operating under the laws of identification. This is not a task. If you try to achieve this and set it up as a goal, your mind is involved and you will log jam at the outset. Relax. Resting mind activity disarms gross identification. There is no \u0027how\u0027 to stop thinking. Simply stop getting involved in the stories of your thoughts. Stopping is not a doing, not a technique, not to be learned. Neither is it a big deal. Just be quiet, be still, and stop participating in the imaginary world created by your thoughts.",

All experiences come and go. Truth remains, unchanging and complete. Do not stop short on your inner enquiry just because your mind is still. If you can experience stillness, you will also experience agitation. All states have their opposite. Do not decide that stillness or an experience of peace is enough. There is no experience that can give you anything other than experience. Reject all such tricks that the mind presents.

This self-control is with a small \u0027s\u0027 and refers to controlling the mind, the thoughts of the mind. Self control is when your mind is not leaking anything perishable, when your mind touches nothing that fades. No clinging to the past, no thoughts, no expectations for any future. Keeping mind between past and future is mind control and this is your face. This is not so easy. People have been trying to do this for so long. Five thousand years ago Arjuna asked Krishna how to control the mind which is as difficult to grasp as air. Krishna said: \\By Abhyasa, practice, and Vairagya, non-attachment, you will control the mind. Vairagya is being non-attached to objects. Abhyasa is bringing the mind back from its objects and establishing it in me\\. So sit quiet and watch the mind. It will want to go and enjoy the past experiences and enjoyments. Bring it back. If you are aware of the thief it will not steal from you, but if you are not aware then the thief will not let you be happy. It will loot the property of peace. This happens everyday and we enjoy it. We actually make friends with the snake. Keep after this inner dialogue and it will stop, if you have strong determination. All these objects of the mind are only projections. Only when you stop the projecting will you be happy. When the projection is finished then only the screen is left. This screen is the same before, during, and after the projections. When mind stops there is no projection, this is the blissful state.",

Consider the case of the worshipper. He approaches God and prays to be absorbed in Him. He then surrenders himself in faith and by concentration. And what remains afterwards? In the place of the original \u0027I\u0027, self-surrender leaves a residuum of God in which the \u0027I\u0027 is lost. That is the highest form of devotion or surrender and the peak of detachment.",

However much her keeper tempts her with luscious grass and fine fodder, she refuses the first time; then she takes a bit; but her innate tendency to stray away asserts itself; and she slips away; on being repeatedly tempted by the owner, she accustoms herself to the stall; finally even if let loose she would not stray away.

Let them come, no matter how much they seem to frighten you, no matter how powerful they appear to be, let them come. Where do the thoughts come from to begin with? They come from nowhere. They do not come from consciousness. They do not come from pure awareness. They do not come from the Self. Where do the thoughts come from? From nowhere. They\u0027re an optical illusion. They do not exist. They\u0027re like the appearance of the sky on top of the mountain. The sky appears to be resting on top of the mountain, but it\u0027s an optical illusion. Thoughts do not exist, whatsoever. Therefore you ask yourself: \\Who\u0027s thinking?\\ and you will find out, the ego is thinking. So here\u0027s another point. When the thoughts slow down, so does the ego. The thoughts and the ego are synonymous. As the thoughts slow down, the ego slows down, and begins to also disappear with the thoughts. When there are no thoughts, there\u0027s no ego. When there\u0027s no ego, there\u0027s nobody left to think. Then the question you will ask is: \\How do I function without thinking?\\ As I mentioned in the beginning, the sage\u0027s thoughts are like a burnt rope. They appear to be real, but they\u0027re not. In other words, your thoughts are not real. They are false. How do you function without thoughts? Very well, thank you. Many of you still believe you have to have thoughts to function. You think you\u0027ll become a vegetable, but you will be spontaneous without thoughts. You\u0027ll be motivated by the Self.

There are numberless persons small and big and very big, who, through identification, imagine themselves as acting, but it does not change the fact that the world of action (mahadakash) is one single whole in which all depends on, and affects all. The stars affect us deeply and we affect the stars. Step back from action to consciousness, leave action to the body and the mind; it is their domain.

It will easily become obvious on its own (because it\u0027s already here), when you start realizing that there is greater benefit in resting in Being, than there is in worrying about life, time, cause and effect. For as long as you perceive great benefit in worry and concern, for exactly that long will you believe you are unworthy of causeless joy. When your love for the unexplainable mystery of here-and-now life as-it-is outshines your love of stories and knowledge, you again regain the innocence of a child, the appearance of a fool, the mind of a master, the heart of a dog and you\u0027ll inherit the natural bliss that comes with the surrender to not-knowing.",

It is simply being absorbed in the moment in such a way - that the past disappears from your vision, the future has crumbled to dust, and what is left is just pure unwavering attention in action. Direct, immediate, exploding with creativity, when this moment becomes both your first and your last moment - you are on the edge of no return.",

You challenge them by repeatedly asking yourself \\Who am I? Who is the person who is having these thoughts?\\ If the challenge is to be effective you must make it before the rising thought has had a chance to develop into a stream of thoughts. Mind is only a collection of thoughts and the thinker who thinks them. The thinker is the \u0027I-thought\u0027, the primal thought which rises from the Self before all others, which identifies with all other thoughts and says, \u0027I am this body\u0027. When you have eradicated all thoughts except for the thinker himself by ceaseless enquiry or by refusing to give them any attention, the \u0027I-thought\u0027 sinks into the Heart and surrenders, leaving behind it only an awareness of consciousness. This surrender will only take place when the \u0027I-thought\u0027 has ceased to identify with rising thoughts. While there are still stray thoughts which attract or evade your attention, the \u0027I-thought\u0027 will always be directing its attention outwards rather than inwards. The purpose of self-enquiry is to make the \u0027I-thought\u0027 move inwards, towards the Self. This will happen automatically as soon as you cease to be interested in any of your rising thoughts.",

    "quotes": "It was in 1896, about 6 weeks before I left Madurai for good (to go to Tiruvannamalai-Arunachala) that this great change in my life took place. I was sitting alone in a room on the first floor of my uncle\u0027s house. I seldom had any sickness and on that day there was nothing wrong with my health, but a sudden violent fear of death overtook me. There was nothing in my state of health to account for it nor was there any urge in me to find out whether there was any account for the fear. I just felt I was going to die and began thinking what to do about it. It did not occur to me to consult a doctor or any elders or friends. I felt I had to solve the problem myself then and there. The shock of the fear of death drove my mind inwards and I said to myself mentally, without actually framing the words: \u0027Now death has come; what does it mean? What is it that is dying? This body dies.\u0027 And at once I dramatised the occurrence of death. I lay with my limbs stretched out still as though rigor mortis has set in, and imitated a corpse so as to give greater reality to the enquiry. I held my breath and kept my lips tightly closed so that no sound could escape, and that neither the word \u0027I\u0027 nor any word could be uttered. \u0027Well then,\u0027 I said to myself, \u0027this body is dead. It will be carried stiff to the burning ground and there burn and reduced to ashes. But with the death of the body, am I dead? Is the body I? It is silent and inert, but I feel the full force of my personality and even the voice of I within me, apart from it. So I am the Spirit transcending the body. The body dies but the spirit transcending it cannot be touched by death. That means I am the deathless Spirit.\u0027 All this was not dull thought; it flashed through me vividly as living truths which I perceived directly almost without thought process. I was something real, the only real thing about my present state, and all the conscious activity connected with the body was centered on that \u0027I\u0027. From that moment onwards, the \u0027I\u0027 or Self focused attention on itself by a powerful fascination. Fear of death vanished once and for all. The ego was lost in the flood of Self-awareness. Absorption in the Self continued unbroken from that time. Other thought might come and go like the various notes of music, but the I continued like the fundamental sruti note [\u0027that which is heard\u0027] a note which underlies and blends with all other notes.",

If you reply, as most do, that it is Mind or Nature or Buddha or one\u0027s Face before birth or one\u0027s Original Home or Koan or Being or Nothingness or Emptiness or Form-and-Color or the Known or the Unknown or Truth or Delusion, or say something or remain silent, or regard it as Enlightenment or Ignorance, you fall into error at once. However much you try to know it through logical reasoning or to name or call it, you are doomed to failure. And even though all of you becomes one mass of questioning as you turn inward and intently search the very core of your being, you will find nothing that can be termed Mind or Essence. Yet should someone call your name, something from within will hear and respond. Find out this instant who it is! If you push forward with your last ounce of strength at the very point where the path of your thinking has been blocked, and then, completely stymied, leap with hands high in the air into the tremendous abyss of fire confronting you - into the ever-burning flame of your own primordial nature - all ego-consciousness, all delusive feelings and thoughts and perceptions will perish with your ego-root and the true source of your Self-nature will appear. You will feel resurrected, all sickness having completely vanished, and will experience genuine peace and joy.",

This state is often mistaken for Self-realization. But continue to ask yourself even more intensely: \\Now who is it that hears?\\ If you bore and bore into this question, oblivious to anything else; even this feeling of voidness will vanish and you will be unaware of anything - total darkness will prevail. Don\u0027t stop here, but keep asking with all your strength, \\What is it that hears?\\ Only when you have completely exhausted the questioning will the question burst; now you will feel like a man come back from the dead.

With such realization you achieve true emancipation.

This is when you know you\u0027re making progress. For there are no longer any thoughts. The thoughts begin to slow up. As the thoughts slow up the mind becomes quieter. When you say \\Who am I?\\ nothing will happen. As you keep doing this week after week, the space will become greater and greater. The space between \\Who am I?\\ and \\To whom do these thoughts come?\\ when you do it over again, will become greater and greater. And that space is your reality. That space is consciousness, that space is pure awareness and everything will happen by itself. Yet this takes some time with people. This takes some time for this to happen but keep persevering, keep doing it, don\u0027t stop! Sometimes you think you\u0027re overwhelmed by thoughts and you have to keep doing it again and again, but that\u0027s okay. It\u0027s better than some of the things you\u0027re doing. So keep doing it don\u0027t be afraid to do it over and over again. Do it all day long.",

And then, being radically open, is it possible to find a nugget of truth in what they are saying, even if it results in momentary humiliation, and destruction of the image of the one you thought you were? This doesn\u0027t mean you become passive and weak. Quite the opposite. You stop identifying as \u0027victim\u0027 or \u0027hurt one\u0027, and stop seeing the other as \u0027enemy\u0027, and you remain open and vast, the infinite capacity for all life, for all thought and sensation and feeling. And here, in the midst of conflict, you discover the place where conflict ceases to be conflict at all - and wake up to a love beyond reason. Yes, every human relationship is a constant invitation to let go.

Do what you want with my body, with my mind, with my affairs, with everything. Not my will but thine. If you can surrender like this you\u0027re already free.

Boredom means the mind is hungry for more stimulus, more food for thought, and its hunger is not being satisfied. If you can stay bored and restless and observe what it feels like to be bored and restless, you bring awareness to the feeling and there is suddenly some space and stillness around it. A little at first, but as the sense of inner space grows, the feeling of boredom will begin to diminish in intensity and significance. So even boredom can teach you who you are and who you are not. You discover that a \\bored person\\ is not who you are. Boredom is simply a conditioned energy movement within you. Neither are you an angry, sad, or fearful person. Boredom, anger, sadness, or fear are not \\yours\\, not personal. They are conditions of the human mind. They come and go. Nothing that comes and goes is you. \\I am bored.\\ Who knows this? \\I am angry, sad, afraid.\\ Who knows this? You are the knowing, not the condition that is known.",

I felt a little queer - as if I were being carried into something, or as if I were touching some power unknown to me. I had been near it before; I had experienced it several times, but each time I had shaken my head and run away from it. This time I decided not to run away, and - \\Ztt!\\ - I entered. I lost the boundary of my physical body. I had my skin, of course, but my physical body extended to the corners of the world. I walked two, three, four yards, but I felt I was standing in the center of the cosmos. I spoke, but my words had lost their meaning. I saw people coming towards me, but all were the same man. All were myself! Queer, I had never known this world. I had believed that I was created, but now I must change my opinion: I was never created; I was the cosmos; no individual Mr. Sasaki existed. I came to my teacher. He looked at me and said: \\Tell me about your new experience, your entering the transcendental world.\\ Did I answer him? If I spoke, I would come back into the old world.

But realization isn\u0027t some place else; it\u0027s the naturally occurring human state. It doesn\u0027t belong to anybody. It\u0027s who we all are. Spiritual practices also set up many pictures of what this state looks like. For example, when I described how much fear was present, people told me the fear meant that something must be wrong, because fear was an indication that I wasn\u0027t in the proper state. But fear is just what it is, and it\u0027s there too in the vastness of who we are.",

We \u0027look within\u0027 repeatedly to determine what we think and feels, to make a study of ourselves and track our states of mind and heart. Now that there was no longer an \u0027in\u0027 to look \u0027into\u0027, the self-reflective reflex was adrift, but persisted. It kept turning in and turning in, unable to come to terms with the fact that there was no in anymore, only emptiness.",

In seeing both the futility and ultimate impossibility of separating yourself from life itself, you simply lose interest in escaping present experience. It\u0027s way too much effort and only leads to psychological pain. Escaping this moment does not provide what you truly long for. And so what remains is simply a natural willingness to experience everything in its fullness, and not run away into comforting stories, or spiritual concepts. It\u0027s the willingness that you are in your essence.

But the relative can block the absolute, just as the non-churning of the cream may prevent butter from separating.

It is like seeing the surface of the ocean and completely forgetting the immensity beneath. The world is but the surface of the mind and the mind is infinite.

I don\u0027t mean that you become despondent or resigned to your fate. I mean that you truly let go in the face of your utter defeat and stop struggling. And when all the struggle ceases, we realize that the prison of our mind cannot hold us in anymore, because the prison was all along something we imagined into existence. And imagined things aren\u0027t real, they don\u0027t exist. But we could never really see this as long as we were fighting the phantoms of our minds. We needed the one thing that our imaginary minds could not bring about, could not fake or create: the genuine surrender of all struggle. In the blink of an eye, we are no longer confined within illusion nor our attempt to avoid illusion. When all struggle ceases, there is nothing to bind us to a distorted perception of existence and we can finally see. What we see is that we do not simply exist within existence, but all of existence exists within us as well. And although everywhere we look we see the endless diversity of life, we also now see our own true face in everything under the sun.",

Every part of your life goes to God. \\Not my will, but thine.\\ That\u0027s devotion, bhakti. Again, it sounds easy to some people, but it\u0027s not when you get into it, because it means every decision that you have to make is left up to God. You give your mind to God, totally, completely, absolutely. And that leads you to self-realization. Number two is mindfulness, which we were talking about. Becoming the witness. Watching yourself continuously. Watching your thoughts. Watching your actions. Sitting in meditation and watching what goes on in your mind. Not trying to change anything or correct anything. Just observing. Becoming the witness to your thoughts in meditation, and to your actions in the waking state. And number three is the one that I advocate, self-inquiry. Catch the thoughts by becoming aware of the thinker, thats how you do it. Or, just look at the thoughts; ignore them; that stops thoughts.

Finally, in the absence of the urge to escape life, in the recognition that all was ultimately allowed in what I am, the human stuff was allowed to breathe and express and sing and dissolve in its own time.

Imagining that \u0027you\u0027 exist as something or someone separate is the cause of acceptance or rejection of something known. It is illusion telling the story of its own deception. The knower and the known are just concepts seemingly dividing natural non-conceptual knowing. Believing in the thought \u0027I am\u0027 gives seeming reality to the objective world which is constantly changing, yet everything in essence is that changeless natural knowing - nothing else.",

    "quotes": "In recognising presence awareness, there is no thing to see, just natural non-conceptual seeing, as it actually is - without subject or object.  In seeing this, the realisation is immediate - that what is labelled as awareness, consciousness or mind can never be formulated as either a subject or an object. Being empty of a subject or object, it is emptiness seeing - cognising emptiness.  Emptiness can never be emptied of emptiness, nor can it be filled by emptiness. With that concept cancelled out, only the wordless, thoughtless, indescribable emptiness remains. Not a vacuum or a void, but a vivid self-shining, self-knowing, self-aware emptiness, like a clear sky full of light. See for yourself - no one can do it for you. Immediate simplicity - continue to see that the seeing is continuous. Any doubt, question, or argument, and the conceptual seeker seemingly appears again. Yet in that seeing, non-conceptual emptiness remains undisturbed.",

A state of non-differenciation, when you don\u0027t see the difference between you and what you perceive, when you don\u0027t see the separation between you and what you experience. But you have to stop asking questions about anything. You have to forget it all. But you will not do that, because you\u0027re interested in answers, and the answers are knowledge, thoughts.

Because, You\u0027re not one thing� Notice when I stop talking, how quiet it becomes, in your mind. This is the state I\u0027m referring to, the state in between thoughts, when there is nothing going on, in that second, in that moment, when the mind is total quiet, the thoughts are not moving any longer. This is your true self, in that moment in between thoughts. Stay in that moment. Learn to put yourself in that state, whether you are in the market place or you are in a temple, wherever you are, learn to be still. It makes no difference what is going on around you. It makes no difference what other people are doing. You be still. When you are still, then there\u0027s peace. When you are still, there\u0027s happiness. Most of us have been taught that to be happy we have to receive something good. We have to have something nice happen to us to be happy, otherwise we are miserable. Yet the truth is, happiness is your very nature, unalloyed happiness, eternal happiness. You have to go way beyond thoughts, way beyond reasoning, way beyond anything and everything you have ever understood, to be consciousness, to understand consciousness. In order to do this, everything you believe must be dropped. Everything you\u0027ve been led to understand must be transcended. Everything that you can think about has to go. Your ideas of right and wrong, good and bad, up and down, frontwards and sideways, all these things have to be totally transcended, totally removed from your thinking patterns.",

And you\u0027ll say: \\Oh shit! What am I doing?\\ Awakening is not about having a holy divine \u0027energy-groovy-doobie\u0027 nice experience.

If we are using \u0027meditation\u0027 as means to \u0027become\u0027 enlightened, that may prove to be a futile effort. However the Soto Zen model of meditation is highly recommended. It is called shikentaza. It means \u0027just sitting\u0027. You as body/mind are just sitting as the Transparent Being that you already are. Like a mirror or a video camera. Nothing is being added to just resting in vivid nowness. The mind will become completely still naturally and the transparency of Being will become self-evident. It\u0027s a wonderful way to spend some time that enhances the vividness and depth of Clarity, as wel asl relaxing the restlessness of body and mind. The realization of the Soto Zen masters is just as valid as Dzogchen and Mahamudra. Just sitting in a chair or on a cushion with our back straight, the inner energies in the subtle body, chi, prana etc. will settle into their natural condition. The karmic winds or dualistic mind energies will enter the central channel within or along the spine. As that happens all thinking will cease naturally and a radiant Clarity will arise, the transparent Clear Light of Awareness. It has its own Self Knowing along with the Knowing of the total emptiness and space-like nature of all Reality. We simply rest as that empty transparent Radiance, vividly alert, and totally free.",

Don\u0027t struggle with it; just disregard it. Deprived of attention, it will slow down and reveal the mechanism of its working. Once you know its nature and purpose, you will not allow it to create imaginary problems. What problems can there be which the mind did not create? Life and death do not create problems; pains and pleasures come and go, experienced and forgotten. It is memory and anticipation that create problems of attainment or avoidance, coloured by like and dislike.",

    "quotes": "The very first thought \u0027I am\u0027 is surely a thought, but one that does not need any argument or confirmation from the mind. Indeed, as the basis of all further thought, it is the pre-conceptual thought - very source of the mind. Living according to indirect or mediate thought, in a divided, dualistic mind is what most people do because they have identified themselves with a pseudo-entity that considers itself as the subject of all action. But direct or absolute thought is the process by which the Absolute non-manifest manifests itself. Such thought is spontaneous and instantaneous and therefore, without the element of duration which is an aspect of the split mind. Whenever there is duration the thought must necessarily be an after-thought, interpreted phenomenally and dualistically. No spontaneous, non-dual, intuitive thought can arise unless the storm of conceptual thinking has subsided and the mind rests in a \u0027fasting\u0027 state; and such thought obviously cannot know bondage. Instantaneous, pure thought results in pure action without any tinge of bondage, because no entity is involved.",

Would Sri Bhagavan be pleased to explain how best to practise meditation and what form the object of meditation should take?\\ Ramana: Effortless and choiceless awareness is our real nature. If we can attain it or be in that state, it is all right. But one cannot reach it without effort, the effort of deliberate meditation. All the age-long vasanas carry the mind outward and turn it to external objects. All such thoughts have to be given up and the mind turned inward. For that, effort is necessary for most people. Of course everybody, every book says: \\Summa iru\\ (\\Be quiet or still\\). But it is not easy. That is why all this effort is necessary. Even if we find one who has at once achieved the mauna or Supreme state indicated by \\Summa iru\\, you may take it that the effort necessary has already been finished in a previous life. So that, effortless and choiceless awareness is reached only after deliberate meditation. That meditation can take any form which appeals to you best. See what helps you to keep away all other thoughts and adopt that method for your meditation.",

Reality is not the result of a process; it is an explosion. It is definitely beyond the mind, but all you can do is to know your mind well. Not that the mind will help you, but by knowing your mind you may avoid your mind disabling you. You have to be very alert, or else your mind will play false with you. It is like watching a thief - not that you expect anything from a thief, but you do not want to be robbed.

In realising that there is no separate person here at all, that who I really am is the vast, open, infinitely spacious, non-located capacity for every thought, sensation, feeling, sound, even pain, and that what I am is inseparable from this moment... well then, everything is seen to be deeply embraced, held, admitted here, deeply allowed into what I am. There is no \u0027inbetween\u0027 anymore, and never was. There is no self-image to defend (not even the image \\there\u0027s nobody here\\ or \\awakening has happened to no-one\\), no way of blocking life out, total openness to what is, cosmic humility and awe in the face of this moment. This is not a prescription or achievement or goal for a separate self, but a description of who you ALREADY ARE beyond the story.",

Now what is this Mind? It is the true nature of all sentient beings, that which existed before our parents were born and hence before our own birth, and which presently exists, unchangeable and eternal. So it is called one\u0027s Face before one\u0027s parents were born. This Mind is intrinsically pure. When we are born it is not newly created, and when we die it does not perish. It has no distinction of male or female, not has it any coloration of good or bad. It cannot be compared with anything, so it is called Buddha-nature. Yet countless thoughts issue from this Self-nature as waves arise in the ocean or as images are reflected in a mirror. If you want to realize your own Mind, you must first of all look into the source from which thoughts flow. Sleeping and working, standing and sitting, profoundly ask yourself, \\What is my own Mind?\\ with an intense yearning to resolve this question. This is called \\training\\ or \\practice\\ or \\desire for truth\\ or \\thirst for realization.\\ What is termed Zazen is no more than looking into one\u0027s own mind. It is better to search your own mind devotedly than to read and recite innumerable sutras and dharani every day for countless years. Such endeavors, which are but formalities, produce some merit, but this merit expires and again you must experience the suffering of the Three Evil Paths.

Both sleep and waking are misnomers. We are only dreaming. True waking and true sleeping only the jnani knows. We dream that we are awake, we dream that we are asleep.

If you don\u0027t cooperate with them, sooner or later they are bound to leave you. If this method doesn\u0027t appeal to you, then just watch the mind with full attention. Whenever the mind wanders, become aware of it. See how thoughts connect with each other and watch how this ghost called mind catches hold of all your thoughts, saying, \\This is my thought\\.

If you wish to practice self-inquiry, do that. In other words, do whatever you have to do to stop your mind from thinking. Vichara, self-inquiry, is only to keep your mind from thinking. That\u0027s all it is. All the practices of yoga lead to the place where you stop thinking. All of the higher religions are to make your thoughts one-pointed.

Take the instance of moving pictures on the screen in the cinema show. What is there in front of you before the play begins ? Merely the screen. On that screen you see the entire show, and for all appearances the pictures are real. But go and try to take hold of them. What do you take hold of ? Merely the screen on which the pictures appeared. After the play, when the pictures disappear, what remains ? The screen again. So with the Self. That alone exists, the pictures come and go. If you hold on to the Self, you will not be deceived by the appearance of the pictures. Nor does it matter at all if the pictures appear or disappear. Ignoring the Self the ajnani thinks the world is real, just as ignoring the screen he sees merely the pictures, as if they existed apart from it. If one knows that without the seer there is nothing to be seen, just as there are no pictures without the screen, one is not deluded. The jnani knows that the screern and its pictures are only the Self. With the pictures the Self is in its manifest form; without the pictures it remains in the unmanifest form. To the jnani it is quite immaterial if the Self is in one form or the other. He is always the Self. But the ajnani seeing the jnani active gets confounded.",

Q: When I was younger, I had strange experiences, short but memorable, of being nothing, just nothing, yet fully conscious. But the danger is that one has the desire to recreate from memory the moments that have passed. M: This is all imagination.

Why remember them and then make memory into a problem? Be bland about them; do not divide them into high and low, inner and outer, lasting and transient.

It is spontaneously present before any thought or concept appears. Being distracted by the conceptual stream is why the sense of \u0027not getting there yet\u0027 pervades the mind. Doubt is only a thought. Being is not a concept or thought. Be what you are. Let the mind be free to rest on nothing. Let thoughts come and go. In this way the natural state, seeing-knowing, will reveal that emptiness is your true nature... and the beauty of the entire manifestation will dissolve all boundaries in the mind. The timeless nature of awareness itself will open (is openness itself ) and reveal its all inclusiveness. Revelation is the nature of \u0027what is\u0027.",

It is not a probing into the faculties, urges, memories or tendencies of one\u0027s conscious or subconscious mind but a quest of the pure I-am-ness that lies behind all these. It consists in turning the mind inwards to the sense of being, the feeling of \u0027I am\u0027. The purpose of enquiry is to make one aware of being at will and for longer and longer periods. In enquiry there is only the subject. You are not looking for anything new, anything outside yourself, but simply concentrating or paying attention on being, on your self, on the pure \u0027I am\u0027 in you. It is not thinking but suspending thought while retaining consciousness. The only way is persistence. Constant alertness... Not to get carried away by thoughts. To see them aloofly like clouds passing over a clear sky and ask, \\What is this thought? Who did it come to? To me, but who am I?\\ And so you bring your mind back to enquiry. (Arthur Osborne)",

The Ultimate Reality is that there is not, nor has there ever been a you to take claim of any object of awareness. There is no self. Enlightenment is simply pure selfless awareness of everything that arises moment to moment. It is a ghostly feeling of non-being combined with hammering clarity. It is a shimmering beauty beyond earthly description that is felt by emptiness. You are that emptiness and have always been that. There has only ever been enlightenment. There has only ever been existence/awareness. Feel the emptiness, your non-being as the universe expands to infinity. Walk into a crowded room and never find yourself. If you can do these then you will know you are already enlightened and in that knowing you will realize you have always known this and yet have never existed to know it.

It may say: \\There is no value in simply being. There is only value in becoming\\. And by accepting this, it will rob you of your inherent peace and silence. To be the Self is not a state of laziness. It is to be in natural harmony. Keep the attention here in the silence of being. And at the same time you can notice that your activities don\u0027t suffer from your attention being in being. The invitation here is to go completely through the forest of mind into the pure recognition of what is timeless and perfect. This is completely possible here. Don\u0027t be afraid.

If you would know the substance of the Mind-Buddha, the very instant you hear a sound search for this one who hears. Thus you will unfailingly come to the realization that your own Mind is no different from Kannon\u0027s. This Mind is neither being nor non-being. It transcends all forms and yet is inseparable from them. Do not try to prevent thoughts from arising and do not cling to any that have arisen. Let thoughts appear and disappear as they will, don\u0027t struggle with them. You need only unremittingly and with ail your heart ask yourself \\What is my own Mind?\\ I keep urging this because I want to bring you to Self-realization. When you persistently try to understand with the intellect what is beyond the domain of the intellect, you are bound to reach a dead end, completely baffled. But push on. Sitting or standing, working or sleeping, probe tirelessly to your deepest self with the question \\What is my own Mind?\\ Fear nothing but the failure to experience your True-nature! This is Zen practice. When this intense questioning envelops every inch of you and penetrates to the very bottom of all bottoms, the question will suddenly burst and the substance of the Buddha-mind be revealed, just as a mirror concealed in a box can reflect its surroundings only after the box is broken apart. The radiance of this Mind will light up every corner of a universe free of even a single blemish. You will be liberated at last from all entanglements within the Six Realms, all effects of evil actions having vanished. The joy of this moment cannot be put into words.",

Just witnessing, not interfering not even judging, because the moment you judge you have lost the pure witness. The moment you say \\this is good, this is bad\\, you have already jumped onto the thought process. It takes a little time to create a gap between the witness and the mind. Once the gap is there, you are in for a great suprise, that you are not the mind, that you are the witness, A watcher. And this process of watching is the very alchemy of real religion. Because as you become more and more deeply rooted in witnessing, thoughts start disappearing. You are, but the mind is utterly empty. That\u0027s the moment of enlightenment.

As each thought arises one must be watchful and ask to whom is this thought occurring. The answer will be \\to me\\. If you enquire \\Who am I?\\ the mind will return to its source (or where it issued from). The thought which arose will also submerge.

The light in the hall burns both when persons are present and when they are absent, both when persons are enacting something, as in a theatre, and when nothing is being enacted. It is the light which enables us to see the hall, the persons and the acting. We are so engrossed with the objects or appearances revealed by the light, that we pay no attention to the light. In the waking or dream state in which things appear, and in the sleep state in which we see nothing, there is always the light of Consciousness or Self, like the hall lamp which is always burning.

The one who believes they are a body, a doer. When you get rid of the misconceptions you\u0027re a doer or a watcher you\u0027ll have nothing to watch and nothing to do.

There is a dimension within a human being which is birthless and deathless, beyond shape and form. People who have no inner experience at all and are simply parroting what they have heard from others, for them - there can only be heaps of misunderstandings. The reason why various masters have said that there is no individual who becomes enlightened, is basically because your fundamental nature is not something which can be grasped. The problem is that the mind is always trying to impose its own limitations onto the Unthinkable. That is why, the whole spiritual process involves cutting through all of your identifications of the mind. If you realize your fundamental nature, but at the same time you continue clinging to a self-image, then once again you have become identified with a projection of your own mind. That does not mean that there is nothing within you which is beyond the mind and body. It just means that - to live in communion with it, the boundaries of your identity will have to dissolve completely. This is why there is no \u0027ego\u0027 which becomes enlightenment - there is only enlightenment itself.",

When all your questions are answered, my talks are very easy to understand. And when you understand, all your questions have gone. It is a vicious circle: So long as you have questions, you cannot follow what is being said. I am going for the basic questions only: What are you? Since when are you? How did you happen to be? And due to what are you? I don\u0027t want to deal with a lot of sundry questions; they are of no value to me. If you like my teachings, you may sit here; otherwise, by all means quit this place. In any true spiritual search, whatever you have heard, whatever you have done, is of no use at all to arrive at the real truth. The knowledge \\you are\\ has happened. Due to what? First of all, you witness that you are. Stay put there only, with this \\you are.\\ Just be there. Then with the help of this \\you are\\, you are witnessing the world. If you are not witnessing \\you are\\, you will not be witnessing the world either.",

That cannot hide anywhere because it is pure presence, here-now, all the time everywhere. That, as Consciousness, is all there is, other than That nothing is. That, as pure subjectivity, is without the slightest trace of objectivity, and it is for this reason that the individual seeker cannot find it. It is That Consciousness which exists as each being, but not as That. When we look for That, we cannot find it because it is That which we are, not this (psychosomatic organism) which we think we are. Words cannot make this clear, and it was therefore that one Master instructed a disciple, \\Do not let yourself be put out by a sutra, put out the sutra instead!\\ Words can only be pointers, but we have perforce to use them until that is unnecessary. Once the sense can be maintained, the words must be abandoned.",

Nothing was divided and there is nothing to unite. Q: Yoga helps in the search for and the finding of the self. M: You can find what you have lost. But you cannot find what you have not lost. Q: Had I never lost anything, I would have been enlightened. But I am not. I am searching. Is not my very search a proof of my having lost something? M: It only shows that you believe you have lost. But who believes it? And what is believed to be lost? Have you lost a person like yourself? What is the self you are in search of? What exactly do you expect to find? Q: The true knowledge of the self. M: The true knowledge of the self is not a knowledge. It is not something that you find by searching, by looking everywhere. It is not to be found in space or time. Knowledge is but a memory, a pattern of thought, a mental habit. All these are motivated by pleasure and pain. It is because you are goaded by pleasure and pain that you are in search of knowledge. Being oneself is completely beyond all motivation. You cannot be yourself for some reason. You are yourself, and no reason is needed.",

The only answer is that so long as this question remains, the true understanding with certainty and conviction will not have taken place. The question remains only for someone who has yet to be blessed with the understanding. The happening of the understanding is coincident with the annihilation of the \u0027me\u0027, and so then none remains to ask the question. Such depth of understanding is apperception. It is an understanding and perception that is prior to both knowledge and ignorance. It is beyond the opposites of logic and reason. It is beyond concepts and beliefs. This conviction arises in that silence in which all concepts and beliefs and doubts merge and get annihilated. It is only in that silence that there is relief from the comparison of opposites (known as mentation or thinking) that is the activity of the split-mind of intellect.",

Thus you come to a state in which there is no knowledge, only being, in which being itself is knowledge. To know by being is direct knowledge. It is based on the identity of the seer and the seen. Indirect knowledge is based on sensation and memory, on proximity of the perceiver and his percept, confined with the contrast between the two.",

Nothing sticks to the screen, it remains a screen. Similarly, you remain your own Self in all the three states. If you know that, the three states will not trouble you, just as the pictures which appear on the screen do not stick to it. On the screen, you sometimes see a huge ocean with endless waves; that disappears. Another time, you see fire spreading all around; that too disappears. The screen is there on both occasions. Did the screen get wet with the water or did it get burned by the fire Nothing affected the screen. In the same way, the things that happen during the wakeful, dream and sleep states do not affect you at all; you remain your own Self.",

With your consciousness hold fast to and never abandon the substratum, your real nature, the Supreme that can neither be held nor relinquished. Is the Self something far away that you have to touch? The higher Self exists as one but it is only your thoughts that make you feel it is not. You can neither think about it nor forget it. Other than the thought of the Self, any other thought you may associate with, is a mere mental construct, foreign to that Self. Thinking of the Self is to abide as that tranquil consciousness. Padam, the true swarupa, can neither be remembered nor forgotten. The Self is self-luminous without darkness and light, and is the reality which is self-manifest. Therefore, one should not think of it as this or that. All such thoughts would only end in bondage. The purport of meditation on the Self is to make the mind take the \u0027form\u0027 of the Self. In the middle of the heart-cave is the pure Brahman directly manifest as the Self in the form of \u0027I-I\u0027.

We have seen already that the ego has an element of reality mixed up in it, namely the light of Consciousness, manifest as \u0027I am\u0027. This \u0027I am\u0027, we know, is real, because it is the part that is constant and unchanging. We need to reject the unreal part, the sheaths or bodies, and take the remainder, the pure \u0027I am\u0027. This \u0027I am\u0027 is a clue to the finding of the real Self. By holding on to this clue, the Sage tells us, we can surely find the Self. He once compared the seeker of the Self to a dog seeking his master, from whom he had been parted. The dog has something to guide him, namely the master\u0027s scent. By following the scent, leaving everything else, he ultimately finds his master. The \u0027I am\u0027 in the ego-sense is just like the master\u0027s scent for the dog. It is the only clue the seeker has for finding the Self. But it is an infallible clue. He must get and keep hold of it, fix his mind on it to the exclusion of all other things. It will then surely take his mind to the Self, the source of the \u0027I am\u0027.",

The final goal is only oneness, and to experience oneness our mind must subside, which will happen entirely only when we attend to nothing other than ourself. So long as we attend to anything other than ourself, our mind cannot subside, because attention to other things sustains it, since that which experiences otherness is only this mind.

This is the change that is coming into your life. In other words if you want self-realization you\u0027ve got to get rid of everything. Everything that you\u0027ve been holding onto. Everything that you\u0027ve been holding onto, everything. I mean give it up mentally. If things happen physically you just don\u0027t react to it. But mentally you give up all the stuff that has been bothering you for all these years. You surrender everything to God. Empty yourself out completely, totally. Again you do this by not reacting to anything. Not allowing the world to get to you, show you anything. You keep holding on and holding on. Holding on to nothing. Becoming nothing more and more. No longer worrying. Then all of a sudden you see a light inside of you. The light brings you untold happiness and peace. The light grows steadily. The lights in your heart. The light of a thousand suns. To give everything up to this light. You\u0027re no longer afraid. You are free.",

Then the energy of the mind and senses begin to spontaneously withdraw inwards onto themselves, as though being absorbed by the gravitational pull of a black hole. Just through one-pointed attention alone, the whole existence from the finite to the infinite will reveal itself to you. But the whole paradox is that one\u0027s attention has to become so immersed, that there is not even a shred of some goal to achieve in the future.

Jac: The pointer that is suggested is to place attention where thoughts arise from. This suggests a sense of a place or even a blank image can arise for some - like a blank canvas before the picture appears on it. With Advaita it can be taken as a general guideline that when the mind asks \\how\\ it\u0027s nothing more than avoidance of following the lead that is suggested. One could just as easily be running any thought (e.g. \\I\u0027d love a coffee.\\) as running the \\how\\ thought. Asking how is simply running another thought and not following the suggestion. So it\u0027s not about finding out \\how\\, it\u0027s about following the lead regardless of what happens. You can\u0027t really get it wrong; it\u0027s the willingness to give it a go that is required. Then what happens, happens. The \\how\\ of it all, together with right and wrong outcomes can be ignored. We are stepping beyond such judgements when placing attention prior, from where thoughts arise.",

When the mind comes out of the Self, the world appears. Therefore, when the world appears (to be real), the Self does not appear; and when the Self appears (shines) the world does not appear. When one persistently inquires into the nature of the mind, the mind will end leaving the Self (as the residue). What is referred to as the Self is the Atman.

    "quotes": "What we normally call the mind is the deluded mind, a turbulent vortex of thoughts whipped up by attachment, anger, and ignorance. This mind, unlike enlightened awareness, is always being carried away by one delusion after another. Thoughts of hatred or attachment suddenly arise without warning, triggered by such circumstances as an unexpected meeting with an enemy or a friend, and unless they are immediately overpowered with the proper antidote, they quickly take root and proliferate, reinforcing the habitual predominance of hatred or attachment in the mind and adding more an more karmic patterns. Yet, however strong these thoughts may seem, they are just thoughts and will eventually dissolve back into emptiness. Once you recognize the intrinsic nature of the mind, these thoughts that seem to appear and disappear all the time can no longer fool you. Just as clouds form, last for a while, and then dissolve back into the empty sky, so deluded thoughts arise, remain for a while, and then vanish into the voidness of mind; in reality nothing at all has happened. When sunlight falls on a crystal, lights of all colors of the rainbow appear; yet they have no substance that you can grasp. Likewise, all thoughts in their infinite variety - devotion, compassion, harmfulness, desire - are utterly without substance. There is no thought that is something other than voidness; if you recognize the void nature of thoughts at the very moment they arise, they will dissolve. Attachment and hatred will never be able to disturb the mind. Deluded emotions will collapse by themselves. No negative actions will be accumulated, so no suffering will follow.",

Like this, thoughts lose their power and subside from lack of the fuel of attention. Just stay as the Awareness. And when I say \\stay as the Awareness\\, I am not referring to an action to be taken or the product of some method or practice. Actually, there is no one \\staying\\ as the Awareness. This pointing is to bring the attention to where Awareness is and let it merge there. Finally, this thought of staying there must drop away also. You just come to the full recognition that all there is is Awareness and your Self is That. You must first enter and be one with the state of Presence and Being and you will spontaneously know. Here, we are one.",

Meditation is the ending of thought, not by the meditator, for the meditator is the meditation. If there is no meditation, then you are like a blind man in a world of great beauty, light and colour. Wander by the seashore and let this meditative quality come upon you. If it does, don\u0027t pursue it. What you pursue will be the memory of what it was - and what was is the death of what is. Or when you wander among the hills, let everything tell you the beauty and the pain of life, so that you awaken to your own sorrow and to the ending of it. Meditation is the root, the plant, the flower and the fruit. It is words that divide the fruit, the flower, the plant and the root.

The final goal is only Oneness, and to experience Oneness our mind must subside, which will happen entirely only when we attend to nothing other than ourself. So long as we attend to anything other than ourself, our mind cannot subside, because attention to other things sustains it, since that which experiences otherness is only this mind. When the mind subsides completely, only self-attention remains, and self-attention alone is the state of absolute Oneness. Bhagavan used to repeat this teaching every day, maybe ten or twenty times, but still we didn\u0027t change. He didn\u0027t change his teaching either, because to him this truth was so clear.",

If we make an effort to change we do no more than shift our attention from one level, from one thing, to another. We remain in a vicious circle. This only transfers energy from one point to another. It still leaves us oscillating between suffering and pleasure, each leading inevitably back to the other. Only living stillness, stillness without someone trying to be still, is capable of undoing the conditioning our biologoical, emotional and psychological nature has undergone. There is no controller, no selector, no personality making choices. In choiceless living the situation is given the freedom to unfold. You do not grasp one aspect over another for there is nobody to grasp. When you understand something and live it without being stuck to the formulation, what you have understood dissolves in your openness. In this silence change takes place of its own accord, the problem is resolved and duality ends. You are left in your glory where no one has understood and nothing has been understood.",

    "quotes": "The point is to recognize and remain as your absolutely unconditional state (stateless state) prior to words and concepts, even prior to consciousness or the knowledge \u0027I am\u0027. The knowledge \u0027I am\u0027 is itself appearance. You are there even before you have any knowledge of being. The pointers are put across in a progressive manner, in order to refine away the conceptual identifications, from gross and obvious to more subtle. Many stop along way, feeling that whatever has been understood is \u0027it\u0027. But in fact anything that is \u0027understood\u0027 is never \u0027it\u0027, because your nature is really prior to understanding, prior to consciousness. The revelation of the nonconceptual absolute is approached through a series of more and more subtle provisional pointers. Any stand, concept, claim or reference point, no matter how \u0027high\u0027, will not stand the final litmus test of itself being the absolute. Even the claim that \u0027I am the non-conceptual absolute\u0027 is still a concept. Knowledge is the final ignorance, the last obstacle. Many get sidetracked, thinking \u0027they know\u0027 and \u0027have arrived\u0027. This brings in a subtle ego that is hard to eradicate. Knowledge is only used to cancel ignorance and then itself is discarded. One in many millions of seekers will have the wherewithal and proper guidance to transcend even self-knowledge (recognition and identification with consciousness). Reality is beyond dualities, including knowledge and ignorance. Nothing is supposed to \u0027happen\u0027. Only see where you really stand. Basically, you are not a concept, are you? Giving yourself a label or verbal description and taking that as reality is the root of the problem and the only apparent bondage there ever was. All pointers are strategies to arrive at this recognition.",

This cannot be brought about by suppression, but by observing every feeling and thought without qualification, condemnation, judgement, or comparison. If unmotivated alertness is to operate the censor must disappear. There must simply be a quiet looking at what composes the mind. In discovering the facts just as they are, agitation is eliminated, the movement of thoughts becomes slow and we can watch each thought, its cause and content as it occurs. We become aware of every thought in its completeness and in this totality there can be no conflict. Then only alertness remains, only silence in which there is neither observer nor observed. So do not force your mind. Just watch its various movements as you would look at flying birds. In this uncluttered looking all your experiences surface and unfold. For unmotivated seeing not only generates tremendous energy but frees all tension, all the various layers of inhibitions. You see the whole of yourself.

And the ego has no intention of relinquishing control. After all, it has been in control since you were just a small child. A part of this process of awakening and becoming permanently established in presence is to come into right relationship with the ego, and with every aspect of whom you have become at the level of mind ego. No longer trying to change or fix yourself or get rid of anything, you enter into a deep and ongoing process of accepting, acknowledging, expressing and confessing every aspect of who you have become. This is only possible when you are awake in Presence.",

The one who understands this reaches the state of Sat-Guru, but an ordinary person cannot understand this. Sat-Guru is not the child of human parents. To know these secrets, to understand these secrets, you surrender to that very principle \u0027I Am\u0027 and that consciousness alone will lead you to this. Presently, stabilize in the consciousness. If you don\u0027t do that, your very concepts will be very dangerous to you - they will throttle you to death. The knowledge you are is the source of all energy, the source of all Gods, of all types of knowledge. Having heard these talks, you need not come again, you have only to abide in that conscioussness you are, that very dynamic principle because of which everything is. Stabilize yourself therein.

Pleasant or unpleasant, your vision remains unprejudiced. Even in being prejudiced, remain unprejudiced about your own prejudice. This is both the first and the last step - and if there are any fruits that are born out of this, they are all side-effects of being in tune with the immediate.

    "quotes": "Thought will never be happy. By nature thought is restless, ever-changing, always seeking something it cannot quite reach. Even when it resolves a problem, the next problem soon pops up. You fix one thing in your life, and the next thing breaks. Thought is always trying to complete the story of \u0027me\u0027, fix it, wrap it up neatly, bring it to a conclusion, take the Me Movie to some kind of resolution, some perfect \u0027final scene\u0027, but the story is endless and has no conclusion, since all form is impermanent and subject to change, and the search just keeps going and going... Thought will never find the permanence it craves. Thought will never be happy, even when it momentarily concludes that \\I am happy\\. That is its nature. And so, perhaps, at some point, there is a kind of disillusionment with thought altogether, a loss of faith in it, a distrust of its supremacy. Attention turns away from thought, away from that which is relentless and restless and always changing, and towards YOU. There is something here, prior to thought, that is ever-present, and always and already at rest, and silently watching and holding thought as it struggles for permanence and happiness. That which sees thought is not itself made of thought. You are the loving space in which thought arises. You are aware of thought, so you are not made of thought, or bound to it. You tenderly hold thought as it wears itself out looking for home. You are thought\u0027s embrace, not its enemy. You are its mother, not its son. Thought will never be happy, but what can be remembered is this effort-free happiness - otherwise known as You - in which thought is allowed to come and go, this natural embrace of all waves in life\u0027s vast ocean. Who you are, beyond even concepts of happiness and unhappiness, is unlimited and ever-present, and even thought\u0027s exhausting search for something it cannot name is deeply allowed to come and go in your limitlessness. You have always been at rest, friend. Your true nature IS rest. And the fact that thought will never be happy is your perfect disillusionment... and your perfect liberation.",

It is the mind that sees objects and has experiences and that finds a void when it ceases to see experience, but that is not you. You are the constant illumination that lights up both the experiences and the void. It is like the theatre light that enables you to see the theatre, the actors and the play while the play is going on but also remains alight and enables you to say that there is no play on when it is all finished. Or there is another illustration. We see objects all around us, but in complete darkness we do not see them and we say, I see nothing, even then the eyes are there to say that they see nothing.

The process which is ego actually consists of a flicker of confusion, a flicker of aggression, a flicker of grasping - all of which exist only in the moment. Since we cannot hold on to the present moment, we cannot hold on to me and mine and make them solid things. The experience of oneself relating to other things is actually a momentary discrimination, a fleeting thought. If we generate these fleeting thoughts fast enough, we can create the illusion of continuity and solidity. It is like watching a movie, the individual film frames are played so quickly that they generate the illusion of continual movement. So we build up an idea, a preconception that self and other are solid and continuous. And once we have this idea we manipulate our thoughts to confirm it, and are afraid of any contrary evidence.

In a moment my mind became silent as a windless air on a high mountain summit and then I saw a thought and then another thought coming in a concrete way from outside; I flung them away before they could enter and take hold of the brain and in three days I was free. From that moment, in principle, the mental being in me became a free Intelligence, a universal Mind, not limited to the narrow circle of personal thought or a labourer in a thought-factory, but a receiver of knowledge from all the hundred realms of being and free too to choose what it willed in this vast sight-empire and thought-empire.",

Some get it done by a slow process of concentration, but that may take a very long time. It is easier to have a quiet mind with things that come in passing on the surface, as people pass in the street, and one is free to attend to them or not - that is to say, there develops a sort of double mind, one inner silent and concentrated when it pleases to be so, a quiet witness when it chooses to see thoughts and things, - the other meant for surface dynamism. It is probable in your case that this will come as soon as these descents of peace, intensity or Ananda get strong enough to occupy the whole system.",

Before they enter, fling them back.\\ I sat down and looked and saw to my astonishment that it was so; I saw and felt concretely the thought approaching as if to enter through or above the head and was able to push it back concretely before it came inside. In three days - really in one - my mind became full of an eternal silence - it is still there. But that I don\u0027t know how many people can do. One (not a disciple - I had no disciples in those days) asked me how to do Yoga. I said:\\Make your mind quiet first.\\ He did and his mind became quite silent and empty. Then he rushed to me saying: \\My brain is empty of thoughts, I cannot think. I am becoming an idiot.\\ He did not pause to look and see where these thoughts he uttered were coming from! Nor did he realise that one who is already an idiot cannot become one. Anyhow I was not patient in those days and I dropped him and let him lose his miraculously achieved silence.",

Happening within openness? Simply by relinquishing control we can discover for ourselves what the natural state is...the state of being which is not contrived. We see what happens when we meditate without the meditator, without the controller. What happens in your own experience? What happens when we are no longer even trying to attain peace or stillness or any goal or any agenda? It is very telling that when we let go of the controller and the manipulator there is a total naturally occurring state of stillness, of openness and of awareness. You start to experience your natural state. The art of meditation is so extraordinarily simple. Letting go. Letting go of directing our experience and the natural state starts to arise. EVERYTHING the mind is trying to attain - the peace, the stillness, the presence, IS naturally occurring and obvious if we are not trying to find it.

If unmotivated alertness is to operate the censor must disappear. There must simply be a quiet looking at what composes the mind. In discovering the facts just as they are, agitation is eliminated, the movement of thoughts becomes slow and we can watch each thought, its cause and content as it occurs. We become aware of every thought in its completeness and in this totality there can be no conflict. Then only alertness remains, only silence in which there is neither observer nor observed. So do not force your mind. Just watch its various movements as you would look at flying birds. In this uncluttered looking all your experiences surface and unfold. For unmotivated seeing not only generates tremendous energy but frees all tension, all the various layers of inhibitions. You see the whole of yourself.

    "quotes": "The mind exists in a state of \\not enough\\ and so is always greedy for more. When you are identified with mind, you get bored and restless very easily. Boredom means the mind is hungry for more stimulus, more food for thought, and its hunger is not being satisfied. If you can stay bored and restless and observe what it feels like to be bored and restless, you bring awareness to the feeling and there is suddenly some space and stillness around it. A little at first, but as the sense of inner space grows, the feeling of boredom will begin to diminish in intensity and significance. So even boredom can teach you who you are and who you are not. You discover that a \\bored person\\ is not who you are. Boredom is simply a conditioned energy movement within you. Neither are you an angry, sad, or fearful person. Boredom, anger, sadness, or fear are not \\yours\\, not personal. They are conditions of the human mind. They come and go. Nothing that comes and goes is you. \\I am bored.\\ Who knows this? \\I am angry, sad, afraid.\\ Who knows this? You are the knowing, not the condition that is known. ",

One must, therefore, watch one\u0027s spiritual progress carefully. One must not allow oneself to be overtaken by such spells of stillness of thought: the moment one experiences this, one must revive consciousness and enquire within as to who it is who experiences this stillness. While not allowing any thoughts to intrude, he must not, at the same time, be overtaken by this deep sleep (Yoga nidra) or Self-hypnotism. Though this is a sign of progress towards the goal, yet it is also the point where the divergence between the road to salvation and Yoga nidra takes place. The easy way, the direct way, the shortest cut to salvation is the Enquiry method. By such enquiry, you will drive the thought force deeper till it reaches its source and merges therein.

I see sensations and thoughts coming and going but I am unchanging.\\ They feel they are enjoying the complete state of Self-realisation. But then unexpectedly, this state is suddenly changing. Many thoughts are coming now and they are not nice ones. Before, there was a shield of protection but now all ugly things are coming through. The awakening honeymoon seems to be over. Now please pay attention. Listen well. This is a form of Grace actually. This phase has come and signals that you must mature further in order to attain complete realisation of the Self. I sometimes say, \\You want to taste the honey, you don\u0027t want to be the honey.\\ What is this honey? It is the satchidananda state, the perfume of the Self experienced as existence, consciousness and bliss. All beings enjoy this state and wish to prolong it, believing it to be the ultimate state. Through these intense satsangs, ego is thinning away and you are beginning to experience an expansion within your being. You are enjoying. You are tasting the honey. Why not? Very nice. Best honey. But then somehow you get a bee sting and the tongue hurts. The honey is gone or feels polluted. What happened? Your beautiful spiritual world has changed. Your spontaneity has gone. Don\u0027t panic. You haven\u0027t done anything wrong. What is important now is that you recognise that you are still totally here as pure qualityless awareness. Grace says, \\You must experience only awareness without the taste of the honey.\\ But this is not acceptable to the \u0027experiencer\u0027 self. It wants the tasting to continue uninterrupted. It wants nothing more. Where is the taste? There is only the tasteless awareness. This \u0027experiencer\u0027 self is a mix of presence and ego and must be transcended before Self-realisation is complete. Remember, just as the flower is not attached to its smell, awareness is not addicted to any state. Now you must be the Self beyond quality. Don\u0027t rely on the fragrance. The initial fragrance is still the subtlest part of phenomenality, but it can and will disappear. But the Self cannot disappear. It cannot even appear for it is infinite and timeless. As soon as you, the true Self, recognise and start marinating in your own emptiness, the attachment to fragrances weaken. Before arriving to this stage, there was no attraction for the ultimate Self, only for its dynamic aspect as presence. Now, as a result of listening to and following these direct pointings you come to find the Supreme joy - the immutable Self. Here is the unfading peace that cannot be described. You are not merely tasting peace. You are peace itself. You are not feeling happy. You are happiness itself. You are beyond the play of interrelated opposites. Beyond the spell of duality. This Realisation few have attained.",

How can I build a bridge between them?\\ There is only one proper answer to give to a person like this. \u0027Your vision is defective.

V: What Sadhana is done to do, then? M: Here again, doing Sadhana means assuming the existence of a phantom. Who is to do Sadhana and for what purpose? Is it not enough to see the false as false? The entity that you think you are is false. You are the reality. Once it is understood, or rather, apperceived intuitively, that an entity is purely a conceptual notion, what remains is merely a re-integration - Yoga - in universality.

Nor is there any path to this inner revolution, for it is neither predictable nor controllable and has a life all its own. This revolution is a breaking away from the old, repetitive, dead structures of thought and perception that humanity finds itself trapped in. Realization of the ultimate reality is a direct and sudden existential awakening to one\u0027s true nature that opens the door to the possibility of an inner revolution. Such a revolution requires an ongoing emptying out of the old structures of consciousness and the birth of a living and fluid intelligence.

Either you are listening with a conclusion, with knowledge, with certain memories, experiences, or you want an answer, and you are impatient. You want to know what it is all about, what life is all about, the extraordinary complexity of life. You are not actually listening at all. You can only listen when the mind is quiet, when the mind doesn\u0027t react immediately, when there is an interval between your reaction and what is being said. Then, in that interval there is a quietness, there is a silence in which alone there is a comprehension which is not intellectual understanding. If there is a gap between what is said and your own reaction to what is said, in that interval, whether you prolong it indefinitely, for a long period or for a few seconds - in that interval, if you observe, there comes clarity. It is the interval that is the new brain. The immediate reaction is the old brain, and the old brain functions in its own traditional, accepted, reactionary, animalistic sense. When there is an abeyance of that, when the reaction is suspended, when there is an interval, then you will find that the new brain acts, and it is only the new brain that can understand, not the old brain.",

If we can attain it or be in that state, it is all right. But one cannot reach it without effort, the effort of deliberate meditation. All the age-long vasanas carry the mind outward and turn it to external objects. All such thoughts have to be given up and the mind turned inward. For that, effort is necessary for most people. Of course everybody, every book says, \u0027Be quiet or still\u0027. But it is not easy. That is why all this effort is necessary.

Most of the people see the tree of knowledge and admire it, but what is to be understood is its source - the seed, the latent force from which it sprouts. Many people talk about it but only intellectually; I talk about it from direct knowledge. A small speck of consciousness, which is like a seed, has all the worlds contained in it.

    "quotes": "Surely, a man who is understanding life does not want beliefs. A man who loves, has no beliefs, he loves. It is the man who is consumed by the intellect who has beliefs, because intellect is always seeking security, protection; it is always avoiding danger, and therefore it builds ideas, beliefs, ideals, behind which it can take shelter. What would happen if you dealt with violence directly, now? You would be a danger to society; and because the mind foresees the danger, it says, \\I will achieve the ideal of nonviolence ten years later\\ - which is such a fictitious, false process. To understand what is, is more important than to create and follow ideals because ideals are false, and what is is the real. To understand what is requires an enormous capacity, a swift and unprejudiced mind. It is because we don\u0027t want to face and understand what is that we invent the many ways of escape and give them lovely names as the ideal, the belief, God. Surely, it is only when I see the false as the false that my mind is capable of perceiving what is true. A mind that is confused in the false can never find the truth. Therefore, I must understand what is false in my relationships, in my ideas, in the things about me, because to perceive the truth requires the understanding of the false. Without removing the causes of ignorance, there cannot be enlightenment; and to seek enlightenment when the mind is unenlightened is utterly empty, meaningless. Therefore, I must begin to see the false in my relationships with ideas, with people, with things. When the mind sees that which is false, then that which is true comes into being and then there is ecstasy, there is happiness.",

We like the sense of overcoming and moving back and through our projections. We are addicted to experiencing and the play of contrasts - the break-ups and the make-ups of life\u0027s seemingly unending dramas. But for those who wish to find Truth immediately, I want to save you time and effort. I want to show you how simple it can be, and that your freedom is already in place. Keep quiet and confirm: Can anything in consciousness appear in your absence? Must you not already be here before anything perceived appears? Therefore, can you be what you are perceiving. Can you be that which comes and goes? Few completely follow what I am pointing, because it is the most direct, the most immediate pointing to the Real. Therefore, the ego-mind feels afraid and resists it. Self-knowledge is not a process of creating yourself but of looking and seeing what must already be complete and who you already are: the one seeing it all. If you can truly hear my words, something becomes very, very simple. The psychological mind will come to make things very complicated and say you are being irresponsible by looking in this way, but it will only succeed if you listen to its voice and become a \u0027person\u0027. Reflect. The Truth is the most simple and beautiful. Remain firmly in the place of undivided presence as presence itself. Here, the altitude of the Heart is too high for the psychological mind to survive. It will quickly suffocate as you stay in the natural state above the mind - the effortless space of Being.",

You do not think of happiness except when you are unhappy. A man who says: \u0027Now I am happy\u0027, is between two sorrows - past and future.

But reality is all and nothing, the totality and the exclusion, the fullness and the emptiness, fully consistent, absolutely paradoxical. You cannot speak about it, you can only lose your self in it. When you deny reality to anything, you come to a residue which cannot be denied. All talk of jnana is a sign of ignorance. It is the mind that imagines that it does not know and then comes to know. Reality knows nothing of these contortions. Even the idea of God as the Creator is false. Do I owe my being to any other being? Because I am, all is.",

So when it\u0027s realized that there is no self apart from the perceiving, then the tendency to try to find one\u0027s Self in any experience, insight, or concept ceases. This is why the highest attainment is not an experience, and it is not something perceivable. It is the death of trying to find yourself because there is no self apart from consciousness.",

    "quotes": "When we are aware of ourselves, is not the whole movement of living a way of uncovering the \\me\\, the ego, the self? The self is a very complex process that can be uncovered only in relationship, in our daily activities, in the way we talk, the way we judge, calculate, the way we condemn others and ourselves. All that reveals the conditioned state of our own thinking, and is it not important to be aware of this whole process? It is only through awareness of what is true from moment to moment that there is discovery of the timeless, the eternal. Without self-knowledge, the eternal cannot be. When we do not know ourselves, the eternal becomes a mere word, a symbol, a speculation, a dogma, a belief, an illusion to which the mind can escape. But if one begins to understand the \\me\\ in all its various activities from day to day, then in that very understanding, without any effort, the nameless, the timeless comes into being. But the timeless is not a reward for self-knowledge. That which is eternal cannot be sought after; the mind cannot acquire it. It comes into being when the mind is quiet, and the mind can be quiet only when it is simple, when it is no longer storing up, condemning, judging, weighing. It is only the simple mind that can understand the real, not the mind that is full of words, knowledge, information. The mind that analyzes, calculates, is not a simple mind.",

Looking into \\I am\\ in every breath is like using time to go beyond time. It introduces the timeless into time, the breathless into breathing, the thoughtless into thought.
