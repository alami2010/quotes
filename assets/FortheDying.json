You are on board with the will of Whatever is taking you Home. Old habits of energy like collapsing into despair and hopelessness can no longer grab you. It\u0027s organic. You just can\u0027t go there anymore. You are standing firm as the Truth and you are grateful, grateful for all the discomfort, all the burning, all of the not-getting-what-you-want, because this is what is driving you back to the unwavering backbone of the Self.",

What\u0027s happening now is, on the deepest level, not an enemy to be feared or rejected, but a dear old friend in disguise, already deeply allowed in the unlimited vastness of what we are. In seeing both the futility and ultimate impossibility of separating yourself from life itself, you simply lose interest in escaping present experience. It\u0027s way too much effort and only leads to psychological pain. Escaping this moment does not provide what you truly long for. And so what remains is simply a natural willingness to experience everything in its fullness, and not run away into comforting stories, or spiritual concepts. It\u0027s the willingness that you are in your essence. The end of suffering is not a personal achievement nor a future state or goal to reach - it\u0027s the simple recognition of the way things already are, and have always been.

I don\u0027t mean that you become despondent or resigned to your fate. I mean that you truly let go in the face of your utter defeat and stop struggling. And when all the struggle ceases, we realize that the prison of our mind cannot hold us in anymore, because the prison was all along something we imagined into existence. And imagined things aren\u0027t real, they don\u0027t exist. But we could never really see this as long as we were fighting the phantoms of our minds. We needed the one thing that our imaginary minds could not bring about, could not fake or create: the genuine surrender of all struggle. In the blink of an eye, we are no longer confined within illusion nor our attempt to avoid illusion. When all struggle ceases, there is nothing to bind us to a distorted perception of existence and we can finally see. What we see is that we do not simply exist within existence, but all of existence exists within us as well.

I have never met anyone � teacher or student � who \\discovered who they really were\\ and never, ever forgot it again, even in the midst of physical pain or the beautiful mess of intimate human relationship. I spent years after my so-called \u0027awakening\u0027 (experience, or non-experience, or whatever I used to call it) meeting all of the unmet human stuff, the untested conditioning, the childhood pain, the pain of all humanity, the unloved waves in the ocean of life, the feelings of failure and doubt and self-importance and arrogance and impotence and the need-to-be-perfect and the need-to-be-right, the forms that had been repressed or ignored or buried for at least a quarter of a century. Finally, in the absence of the urge to escape life, in the recognition that all was ultimately allowed in what I am, the human stuff was allowed to breathe and express and sing and dissolve in its own time. The personal purges itself in the impersonal fire of life, in the furnace of not-knowing, until it becomes absurd to even speak of the impersonal as distinct from the personal... or to even speak of \u0027my awakening\u0027 at all! Liberation may be the end of a belief in a separate \u0027I\u0027, but really, my friends, this is just the beginning of the adventure, however much we want to think of it as some kind of \u0027end point\u0027.

If you can see a thought, is that thought you? If you can see an emotion, is it you? You are the seer, not the objects seen. That which is seen is an object that arises and falls - a temporary form. You are that which is looking at those objects as they arise and fall. Even the notion that there is a seer as a separate identity is an object (an idea) in awareness. In looking inward, there is no separate entity there. There is only awareness recognizing awareness. Awareness is not an object. Your true identity is pure seeing itself. This can be fearful if there is a desire to hold onto some identity. But it is absolutely liberating if you see that even that fear is an object in awareness. Suffering happens when you believe that you are your thoughts and emotions. In reality, you are not angry. Anger is arising. It\u0027s not actually a dreadful day. The thought: \\It\u0027s a dreadful day\\ is arising in awareness. This is not about denying or suppressing thought and emotion. It is about seeing them for what they really are.",

But when you see there is only consciousness, the whole story falls apart. There is no one to get enlightened, and there was never anyone suffering. It was happening in the story, as a story. So this is why many say: \\No one gets enlightened\\. And also, at the same time, you see there was never anyone suffering. All your stories get thrown away. All there is, is consciousness and the stories that are playing in your head�stories of a suffering person, stories of an enlightened person, or stories of an awakened person who must embody his awakening. They are all stories and none of them are true. The only truth is \u0027I Am\u0027, this consciousness is, and you\u0027re done. There is nothing else. There are no levels of attainment. No levels of embodiment. There is no one to embody anything. That is all conceptual nonsense. Believing in that conceptual nonsense is delusional and creates more suffering for yourself!

It\u0027s way too much effort and only leads to psychological pain. Escaping this moment does not provide what you truly long for. And so what remains is simply a natural willingness to experience everything in its fullness, and not run away into comforting stories, or spiritual concepts. It\u0027s the willingness that you are in your essence.

    "quotes": "In a meeting last night someone described the fear that comes up when contemplating losing control and falling into the abyss of nothingness. Thought and physical sensation freak out. There is a sense of urgency to do whatever is possible to stop and come back to the known and the safe sense of \u0027me in control\u0027. It is the fear of death. We are afraid of what we imagine is beyond that boundary of death. But is it beyond a boundary at all? When we imagine it as beyond a boundary we can imagine that it is nicely fenced in so we don\u0027t have to face it. But what if there is no real boundary and no real sense of \u0027me in control\u0027, and what if there never has been? Its not that you need to actively take that step off the cliff into the abyss, but it is to see that you are already falling and always have been.",

    "quotes": "My greatest spiritual guru has always been discomfort. Just sitting with pain or discomfort, without trying to escape in any way, without expectation, without a goal in mind, without seeking anything - that\u0027s the juicy place, the place of creative transformation, the place where mud turns to gold. For many years, I would just sit with grief, frustration, anger, fear, pain, just resting in that bubbling, burning mess for hours and hours, without trying to escape or fix my experience, without hope, without a dream... until peace was discovered even in the midst of that storm, the unshakeable, non-conceptual, ever-present peace that I am, and have always been. Instead of trying to escape discomfort, we let discomfort reveal its deeper secrets. We sit with discomfort and watch all boundaries between \u0027me\u0027 and \u0027discomfort\u0027 melt away, until it is no longer \u0027me sitting with my discomfort\u0027 at all, and never was. We sit with frustration in the place where it has not yet coagulated into \u0027I am frustrated\u0027. We sit with fear prior to the resurrection of the image \u0027I am the one who is afraid\u0027. We sit with anger before the birth of our identity as \u0027the angry one\u0027. We know ourselves as the vast open space, the boundless and identity-less ocean that welcomes all of these waves as its beloved children, returned home at last, home at last.",

Feeling poverty, inside poverty, rather than encountering it he goes on accumulating wealth, so that he can forget that he is poor inside. Seeing that he does not know himself, rather than encountering this ignorance he goes on collecting knowledge, becomes knowledgeable, like a parrot, and goes on repeating borrowed things.

    "quotes": "I am frequently asked about fear. Fear is very often a part of the spiritual path. When people sit down and meditate it\u0027s not at all uncommon for fear to arise at some point. This is especially the case with this sort of meditation, in which we are endeavoring to actually let go of control and manipulation. In most human beings, this will give rise to a certain amount of fear, because the egoic mind is very, very afraid of letting go of control and experiencing open- ness. A lot of fear can arise with meditative self-inquiry as well � when we look within and see that we don\u0027t actually exist as separate entities. When the mind makes contact with the unknown, something it doesn\u0027t understand, it very often goes into fear. We\u0027re often taught that if fear arises there must be some mistake being made, that fear must mean danger. But in spirituality it\u0027s important to remember that fear doesn\u0027t necessarily mean danger. Actually, fear often means that we\u0027re going to a much deeper place inside ourselves. So if fear arises, the wisest thing to do is simply to let it arise. Feel it in your body. Notice that your mind tends to create stories and ideas about the fear, and recognize that these stories aren\u0027t really true. But let the fear be experienced, because fear is often a doorway. It\u0027s something that you must walk through. When you are willing to walk through the fear, to experience it, to see what\u0027s underneath it, to go deeper, then fear has served its purpose. The arising of fear doesn\u0027t always mean that something has gone wrong. Actually, in spirituality, fear often means that something is beginning to go right.",

    "quotes": "If you are looking for the truth about yourself, about life and its meaning, then have no fear: this path is light and full of freedom. But it does require you to take risks. So let\u0027s look at fear, as fear may now raise its head and present you with convincing resistance. We learned about fear as children. Many of us learned that the world is an unsafe place. We may have learned that we are not protected, listened to, understood, or respected. What you learned is stored as information in your mind. You can choose to believe it or not. Because it was hard earned is no reason to keep it alive. Liberation rests in letting it go. No matter how much every lesson was repeated, if it taught you to fear, it is now useless. There is nothing to fear, ever. If you continue to place attention on fear-creating ideas, knowing that your thoughts create emotions, you will feel fear. In a moment, you can decide that enough is enough and end your pattern of feeling fear. What is required of you to live without fear? Trust. Nothing more than trust. If you think you don\u0027t know how to trust, remind yourself what it feels like to trust things that you do trust. For example, you trust that the sun will rise tomorrow, you trust that when you answer the phone you will remember how to speak, you trust that you will remember to put your clothes on before you leave your home in the morning. You trust all of the time. Those places where you have applied this trust flow smoothly and happen without you doing anything. The sun rises, you are able to communicate, you get prepared for the day, trust brings a flow. There is nothing to fear when you trust the unfolding of life. Whatever is presented, no matter the scale, you will respond then, as it happens.",

    "quotes": "Your mind can create great fear to escape the truth. Mind does not want to be redundant. It does not like to serve you instead of directing you. So expect fear to present at the most likely opportunities for realising the Absolute Self. It does not matter what the fear is about, as all fear is founded on your conditioning and is therefore total rubbish. But some thoughts are given so much reverence and attention that, every time one is presented as truthful and convincing, you offer respect by giving it all your attention. When you identify with a persistent thought or fear you merge with it, and when you are one with something you cannot see it. Objectivity is lost for a while. Realise this and let it get as bad as it can become. Let what is going to happen, happen and let what mind can throw at you come too. Mind presents threats and ideas in rapid succession. It can play dirty, but call its bluff and you will see that it has no power beyond the chaotic movement of thoughts. You can identify with them or not. The same system applies. Mind has no other tools to hold you in bondage. When great fear arises, that within you that recognises fear is not fearful. If you can observe fear, then you are not playing victim to this emotion. Place your attention on that which sees fear. From this objective perspective, the thought of fear is no more potent than the thought of a butterfly. Observe and be that which is not fearful, that which is unchanging, reactionless and undisturbed. Fear comes and goes. If you are not attached to it, it will pass. The only staying power availvable is that which is offered by your attention. This is effortless. If you apply effort, your attention is with thoughts. You do not have to control your emotions, senses or feelings. Observe them. Let all that is unfolding, unfold. Let all experiences roll out, and be the perceiving of this unfolding. The Ultimate Seer is not unfolding: it simply is and you are That. You are what was before all sensations that can arise. It is simple and natural to let what is passing, pass. Place your attention on what is here and not moving. Behind every emotion, there is nothingness. Do not feel this as an experience. Because if you feel emptiness as an experience, then mind is active and will soon replace emptiness with fear. This is not about feeling emptiness, it is being emptiness. You cannot try to be it, you are it. You cannot think your way into emptiness, you can only think your way into your thoughts. The golden key here is effortlessness. After all, what is natural requires no technique and no action on your part. Switch off your interest in the movie of your mind, no matter how realistic it appears. Stop actively thinking. Sink into what is unchanging. This is not something to do. It is effortless as it is the not doing of anything that invites the natural state to present in your consciousness. Effortlessly, be that which observes all, and then go to where Ultimate Seeing stems from. Be there and rest there. Totally natural!",

When any arising is experienced, especially thoughts, moods, emotions, or feeling of personal self identity, one simply notices one\u0027s present naked awareness. By directing the attention back to awareness, the arising dissolves back into its origin and its essential nature, awareness. In doing this, the arising releases its formative energy in its dissolution as a surge of further clarity of Clear Light, the power and potency of awareness that energized the arising in the first place. Hence one\u0027s Rigpa presence (Knowing Awareness) is enhanced in the collapse of the formative arising.

One has to be courageous enough to disidentify with the accumulation and to remain in the vacuum. If you are not courageous enough, you will go out and cling to something, and be filled with it. But this moment of being in the vacuum is meditation. If you are courageous enough, if you can remain in this moment, soon your whole being will automatically turn inward. When there is nothing to be attached to from the outside, your being turns inward. Then you know for the first time that you are something that transcends everything you have been thinking yourself to be. Now you are something different from becoming; you are being.

After some time, one of my friends unexpectedly began to chant a traditional incantation in Sanskrit, the Gayatri Mantra.

I felt a deep longing in me, but at the same time a resistance was preventing me from living the current situation to the fullest, from responding with all my being to this invitation from the now, and from merging with it.

Francis: In the first place, be happy that you are aware of this visceral fear, since most people repress and avoid it. As soon as it begins to show its face in a moment of solitude or inactivity, they turn on the television, go see a friend, or throw themselves into some kind of activity. Discovering your fear is, therefore, a crucial first step. Questionner: I don\u0027t know if I discovered it. Perhaps I simply sense its presence. Francis:  Live with it, be interested in it, don\u0027t repress it. Adopt a benevolent attitude toward it, an attitude of letting it come, letting it go. Take it for what it is, an amalgam of thoughts and body sensations. Ask yourself, \\Who is afraid?\\ and you will see the fear-thought depart, leaving only some residues of localized anxiety, the fear-sensation at the somatic level. Basically, all of that is just a show of which you are the spectator. Contemplate that, and contemplate your own reactions, your flight, and your denial. The recognition of your denial is the beginning of acceptance, come what may. In this way, you take the stance of the contemplator, which is your natural stance anyway. So, everything unfolds spontaneously. Fear is your ego; the monster you cart along in your thoughts and body sensations; the usurper that keeps you apart from the joyous realm that belongs to you. See it in its totality. Don\u0027t be afraid of it, even if its features are terrifying. Draw the strength to look at it from your thirst for the absolute, for freedom. When you begin to feel it, think, \\Come here, fear. Show yourself to me. Make yourself at home. I am out of your reach.\\ The effectiveness of this method derives from the fact that fear is something perceived, therefore limited. The longest snake in the world ends somewhere. Once it is entirely out of the tall grass, seen in its entirety, you are out of danger because it can no longer attack you by surprise. Likewise, when you see before you the entirety of your fear, when there is no part of it that is hidden from you, there is no part of you that can identify with it. It is an object that has become unglued from you. The umbilical cord of ignorance by which the ego is nourished is no longer operational. This phantom \u0027I\u0027, no longer being fed, can\u0027t continue to maintain itself. It dies in the explosion of your eternal freedom.",

    "quotes": "Extreme fear � is it suffering? Well, when you\u0027re about to jump out of a plane for a skydive, extreme fear may arise � but it\u0027s part of the excitement, it\u0027s part of the experience, it\u0027s just there. The fear is there � and then you jump. Where is the suffering? There can be fear, even extreme fear, and no suffering, can\u0027t there? The following week, you\u0027re sitting at home, sitting on your sofa � and extreme fear arises. It\u0027s the same fear, but in a different context. It feels like it shouldn\u0027t be there. It lingers. You try and get rid of it but it won\u0027t go away. You try and distract yourself from it, but it remains. You really don\u0027t want it to be there � it\u0027s uncomfortable! So you call up a friend and say \\I\u0027m suffering with fear\\. You ask for help. You want a way out. It feels like the fear is happening \u0027to\u0027 you. It feels like some strange, alien force that has \u0027overtaken\u0027 you. What has happened? It\u0027s clear that something has identified with fear. Something has taken ownership of fear. Something says \\This is my fear � I am afraid.\\ And then something has begun to seek the absence of fear. The fear has become a problem. The fear has turned into a problem � and a problem needs a solution. This is the very definition of seeking. To seek a solution to something that we only assume is a problem. But the fear is the same fear as the fear during the skydive. The fear hasn\u0027t changed � the story has changed, that\u0027s all. Ownership has happened � which is identification. A story has wrapped itself around fear. A story of somebody who is afraid, and somebody who one day will no longer be afraid. Time has come into the picture.",

We live in a time of crisis, both personally and globally, but when crisis is met, face-on, it is no longer disaster, no longer an obstacle to peace, no longer depressing, but an opportunity, a turning point, an invitation to let go of the dream of how things \u0027should\u0027 be, and align totally with the way things actually are.

It is just that something is going so deep in you that you interpret it like a pain. You don\u0027t know anything else. You are only aware of pain in your past life, in your past experience. Whenever something penetrates deep, you interpret it as pain. Don\u0027t use the word \u0027pain\u0027. When love and love\u0027s arrow goes deep into your heart, close your eyes and don\u0027t use words - just see what it is, and you will never see it is pain. You will see it is a benediction. You will be tremendously moved by it. You will feel joyous. Don\u0027t use words. When something new happens to you, always allow a deep look into it without any language.",

For billions of years the sun has given us its awesome power for free. Think of all the burning it has had to endure, in order to shine so brightly and give us life. We are tempted to turn away from our raw, burning hearts, our broken bodies and confused minds, and fixate on a second-hand future goal.

For many years, I would just sit with grief, frustration, anger, fear, pain, loneliness, just resting in that bubbling, burning mess for hours and hours, without trying to escape or fix my experience, without hope, without a dream, without trying to \u0027accept\u0027, without time itself... until peace was discovered even in the midst of that storm, the unshakeable, non-conceptual, ever-present peace that I am, and have always been. Instead of trying to escape discomfort, we let discomfort reveal its deeper secrets. We sit with discomfort and watch all boundaries between \\me\\ and \\my discomfort\\ melt away, until it is no longer \\me sitting with my discomfort\\ at all, and never was - there is only unspeakable embrace. We sit with frustration in the place where it has not yet coagulated into \\I am frustrated\\. We sit with fear prior to the resurrection of the image \\I am the one who is afraid\\. We sit with anger before the birth of our identity as \\the angry one\\. We know ourselves as the vast open space, the boundless and identity-less ocean that welcomes all of these waves, these raw, alive sensations and thoughts, as its beloved children, returned home at last, home at last.
