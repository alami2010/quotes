    "quotes": "Think of the problems you\u0027re thinking about right now. Think. Who has a problem? Your real self can\u0027t have a problem, because that\u0027s bliss consciousness. The problem comes to the ego. Only the ego has a problem, nothing else. Everything is free, happy, no problems. Find out who you are. Discover yourself. Jump within yourself. Be yourself. Become free. Nothing exists as it appears, nothing. Everything is consciousness, and everything is an image superimposed in consciousness. All of your thoughts, whatever is going through your mind, has no basis, no case, no ego. Everything you see is a projection of your own mind. You can put a stop to it by finding the source of your thoughts. Where do your thoughts come from? Find out. Go within. Ask yourself.",

    "quotes": "Allow your mind to say and think the way it will, only don\u0027t identify with it. Allow your body to do what it must, but do not react to it. Everything will happen of its own accord. When you allow your mind to think of its own accord, the thoughts begin to dissipate, and soon you have empty mind. Empty mind is consciousness, realization. That\u0027s all you have to do - have empty mind. But as long as you believe, \u0027I am the doer\u0027, and you force yourself to have an empty mind, you never will, because the forcing makes the mind stronger. Rather, observe your thoughts, watch the mind thinking, and leave it alone. Do not identify with your thoughts, or with your body, for in reality there is no body and there are no thoughts, for there is only the self, and you are that.",

All the books are gone, there are no more teachers for you, there\u0027s no one to ask for help, there\u0027s no one to ask if you\u0027re on the right path. It is then that your sadhana actually begins. Ponder this very well. Your sadhana, your spiritual practice does not begin when you\u0027ve gone to many teachers, and you\u0027ve read many books. It actually begins when you give up everything. That\u0027s when real sadhana begins, when you have surrendered everything, when you\u0027ve emptied yourself of all knowledge, all desires for liberation. When you have become an empty shell, then your spiritual life begins. Until that time you\u0027re only playing games with yourself.",

    "quotes": "Practice this right now. Allow the thoughts to come, whatever they are. Do absolutely nothing. It makes no difference what the thoughts are. Let them come, no matter how much they seem to frighten you, no matter how powerful they appear to be, let them come. Where do the thoughts come from to begin with? They come from nowhere. They do not come from consciousness. They do not come from pure awareness. They do not come from the Self. Where do the thoughts come from? From nowhere. They\u0027re an optical illusion. They do not exist. They\u0027re like the appearance of the sky on top of the mountain. The sky appears to be resting on top of the mountain, but it\u0027s an optical illusion. Thoughts do not exist, whatsoever. Therefore you ask yourself: \\Who\u0027s thinking?\\ and you will find out, the ego is thinking. So here\u0027s another point. When the thoughts slow down, so does the ego. The thoughts and the ego are synonymous. As the thoughts slow down, the ego slows down, and begins to also disappear with the thoughts. When there are no thoughts, there\u0027s no ego. When there\u0027s no ego, there\u0027s nobody left to think. Then the question you will ask is: \\How do I function without thinking?\\ As I mentioned in the beginning, the sage\u0027s thoughts are like a burnt rope. They appear to be real, but they\u0027re not. In other words, your thoughts are not real. They are false. How do you function without thoughts? Very well, thank you. Many of you still believe you have to have thoughts to function. You think you\u0027ll become a vegetable, but you will be spontaneous without thoughts. You\u0027ll be motivated by the Self. You will know what to do, where to go, whom to speak to, whom not to speak to, much better than you do now, much, much better. Things will happen to you spontaneously.",

When we use the mind to stop the thoughts, the mind will not stop the thoughts at all, because the mind wants to go on living. Stopping the thoughts is annihilating the mind, and the mind does not wish to be annihilated. The mind wants to live on, to fill you full of nonsense, superstitions.

Therefore when you give yourself the information that you have to do something to become liberated, there is immediately conflict. This is the only problem you have. It is your conflict. And this conflict comes from programming when you were a child, from samskaras, from previous existence, things that you took with you, the habits that are inside of you, that you believe you are. This is where the conflict comes from. For it tells you \\I\u0027m just a human being, I\u0027m just a frail body. I have to suffer sometimes, sometimes I have to be happy\\. This is all a lie.

I shouldn\u0027t care for any of these things?\\ Mentally, you shouldn\u0027t. Your body will continue to do what it does, and will feel better doing it. Everything is given up mentally.

Start from where you are. No human being is perfect. We all make mistakes. Do not feel sorry for yourself, but start from where you are. Where are you? You are consciousness. This is your true nature. Learn to love everything. Learn to see only the good. Realise there\u0027s a reason for everything. If a person displeases you, simply look the other way and forget it. Learn to stop your mind from thinking. You do this by immediately catching yourself when you react to a condition, and inquiring within yourself: \\Who is becoming angry? Who feels out of sorts?\\ \\I do\\. \u0027I\u0027. Realize you\u0027re dealing with the personal \u0027I\u0027, and that all the anger, all the frustration, all the karma, all the samskaras are all attached to that personal \u0027I\u0027. Consequently, when you get rid of the personal \u0027I\u0027, everything else will go with it. So, don\u0027t try to solve your problems. Do not try to become a better person.

For if you answer the question it\u0027s the ego answering. By asking the question and keeping still, sitting in the silence, the ego will become weaker and weaker. But of course as you sit in the silence in the beginning stages, more thoughts will come into your mind you repeat the whole thing again: \\To whom do these thoughts come? Who is thinking this?\\ Again, \\I am. I feel this, they come to me\\. Again you separate the \u0027I\u0027 from yourself and you ask, \\Who is this \u0027I\u0027? Who am I? Where does this \u0027I\u0027 come from? What\u0027s its source? Who gave it birth?\\ And you keep still. As you keep still you will find the space between the question \\Who am I?\\ and the thoughts that come again � that you have to ask \\To whom do they come?\\ � will become greater and greater, the space between. This is when you know you\u0027re making progress. For there are no longer any thoughts. The thoughts begin to slow up. As the thoughts slow up the mind becomes quieter. When you say \\Who am I?\\ nothing will happen. As you keep doing this week after week, the space will become greater and greater. The space between \\Who am I?\\ and \\To whom do these thoughts come?\\ when you do it over again, will become greater and greater. And that space is your reality. That space is consciousness, that space is pure awareness and everything will happen by itself. Yet this takes some time with people. This takes some time for this to happen but keep persevering, keep doing it, don\u0027t stop! Sometimes you think you\u0027re overwhelmed by thoughts and you have to keep doing it again and again, but that\u0027s okay. It\u0027s better than some of the things you\u0027re doing.

Again, it sounds easy to some people, but it\u0027s not when you get into it, because it means every decision that you have to make is left up to God. You give your mind to God, totally, completely, absolutely. And that leads you to self-realization. Number two is mindfulness, which we were talking about. Becoming the witness. Watching yourself continuously. Watching your thoughts. Watching your actions. Sitting in meditation and watching what goes on in your mind. Not trying to change anything or correct anything. Just observing. Becoming the witness to your thoughts in meditation, and to your actions in the waking state. And number three is the one that I advocate, self-inquiry. Catch the thoughts by becoming aware of the thinker, thats how you do it. Or, just look at the thoughts; ignore them; that stops thoughts. You cause the thoughts to cease by doing absolutely nothing; by being your self.",

Because, You\u0027re not one thing� Notice when I stop talking, how quiet it becomes, in your mind. This is the state I\u0027m referring to, the state in between thoughts, when there is nothing going on, in that second, in that moment, when the mind is total quiet, the thoughts are not moving any longer. This is your true self, in that moment in between thoughts. Stay in that moment. Learn to put yourself in that state, whether you are in the market place or you are in a temple, wherever you are, learn to be still. It makes no difference what is going on around you. It makes no difference what other people are doing. You be still. When you are still, then there\u0027s peace. When you are still, there\u0027s happiness. Most of us have been taught that to be happy we have to receive something good. We have to have something nice happen to us to be happy, otherwise we are miserable. Yet the truth is, happiness is your very nature, unalloyed happiness, eternal happiness. You have to go way beyond thoughts, way beyond reasoning, way beyond anything and everything you have ever understood, to be consciousness, to understand consciousness. In order to do this, everything you believe must be dropped. Everything you\u0027ve been led to understand must be transcended. Everything that you can think about has to go. Your ideas of right and wrong, good and bad, up and down, frontwards and sideways, all these things have to be totally transcended, totally removed from your thinking patterns.",

    "quotes": "It is when you begin to feel in your heart that you are boundless space, that something begins to happen. As you feel yourself as boundless space, all your stuff begins to drop away. Yet you do not affirm to yourself that you are boundless space. You merely observe, you watch, you become the witness. You look out at the world and you see that the trees, the mountains, the planets, are all hanging in space. And you begin to consider that your body, or what appears to be your body, is like the trees, and the moon, and the sun. It seems to be a thing of itself and it is also hanging in boundless space. Because you are able to observe this and see this and feel this, the realization will come to you that you must be this boundless space, which your body and your mind and the rest of the things of this world are attached to. As you begin to consider this, the mind becomes quieter and quieter and quieter, until the day comes when it falls away completely. Then you become boundless space. And yet you appear to be a body also. This is a paradox. This is why it\u0027s better to sit in the silence and not talk at all.",

It is the mind, the thoughts, that causes these things to come to us. We actually create these conditions. We create our own reality.",

    "quotes": "There are many ways to solve your problems. First of all you have to ask yourself, \\To whom is there a problem? Who has this problem? To whom does this problem come?\\ and separate yourself from the problem immediately. Do not carry it along with you by thinking about it. You must turn away from the problem, totally, completely, absolutely. This doesn\u0027t mean that you do nothing. It simply means that you are not functioning on that problem any longer. And when you\u0027re not functioning any longer, the solution arises. There can only be a correct solution when the mind is not functioning on the problem. ",

    "quotes": "Everyday you should sit a half hour in the morning and a half hour in the evening by yourself. Don\u0027t meditate more than one half hour. Sit by yourself and watch your thoughts. Don\u0027t react to your thoughts. Whatever comes to your mind never react, just watch, smile, and you\u0027re surrendering. As your thoughts come, as thoughts come to you, you no longer pay any attention to it, it doesn\u0027t bother you, that\u0027s surrendering. The next thought comes to you, you don\u0027t pay any attention to it. It doesn\u0027t frighten you, it doesn\u0027t make you happy, it doesn\u0027t make you sad, just watch it and it\u0027ll go away, you surrender that thought. You keep it up, keep it up, and as you keep it up your mind will become calmer and calmer and calmer and quieter and quieter and quieter, until the mind dissolves itself in the heart and you will be free.",

It is when you believe that you are human, when you believe you are a body and a mind, then and only then do you begin to have problems. But if you stop thinking, if you allow yourself not to think, where are the problems? The problems are in the thoughts. Your body is in your thoughts. Your experiences are in your thoughts. Where else would they be? And ultimately the thoughts do not exist. There are no thoughts. There is no mind. So you\u0027re playing games with yourself.

If you can only learn to be calm you will solve every problem. This is something you must remember. When you are perfectly calm, time stops. There is no time, karma stops, samskaras stop. Everything becomes null and void. For when you are calm you are one with the entire energy of the universe and everything will go well with you.",

    "quotes": "The reason it takes so long to become self-realized and become free is you\u0027re looking to do something and in truth there is absolutely nothing to do. There is nothing to do to become free and liberated - What is there to do? If you say, \\I have to try\\, you\u0027re saying the hallucination has to try. Thinking that this is the truth and you have to identify with something to become higher. No. All you have to do is remain still, that is all. Remain quiet, still. Nothing to do. Nothing to become. If you try to become something you get caught in the world of cause and effect and you will have all kinds of problems. But if you\u0027ve made the mind still and quiet then there is no-one to identify with anything and you become free. You don\u0027t become free, you awaken to the freedom that you already are.

In your mind break down the wall and let the thoughts flow into consciousness where they will be totally transcended and consciousness will be your reality. So do not fight your thoughts.",

Because all of the answers come from the same source, the ego. It is the ego that prods you onward, and you\u0027re allowing it to happen. The choice is always yours. This is the freedom that you\u0027ve got. To follow your ego or surrender your ego. That\u0027s the truth you\u0027ve got. And life presents to you all kinds of situations. So you can make a choice.
