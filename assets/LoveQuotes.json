    "quotes": "There is a very simple secret to being happy. Just let go of your demand on this moment. Any time you have a demand on the moment to give you something or remove something, there is suffering. Your demands keep you chained to the dream state of conditioned mind. The problem is that when there is a demand, you completely miss what is now. Letting go applies to the highest sacred demand, and even to the demand for love. If you demand in some subtle way to be loved, even if you get love, it is never enough. In the next moment, the demand reasserts itself, and you need to be loved again. But as soon as you let go, there is knowing in that instant that there is love here already. The mind is afraid to let go of its demand because the mind thinks that if it lets go, it is not going to get what it wants - as if demanding works. This is not the way things work. Stop chasing peace and stop chasing love, and your heart becomes full. Stop trying to be a better person, and you are a better person. Stop trying to forgive, and forgiveness happens. Stop and be still.",

There are no real problems. Everything is welcome and free to arise in you. You are the love in which everything arises. You are that which is aware of all that arises. You are not a separate person who can suffer. There is no separate person, there is only consciousness. There is only consciousness, and consciousness is love. Everything arises in this love that you are.",

So, should the seeker climb the spiritual mountain or simply let go and surrender to life? Is that the question? Or is it possible that there is no question and no answer. Maybe what is sought is all there is. Perhaps the beloved that is longed for is already constantly happening, it never went away, the seeker did, to look for it. Perhaps, when the seeking dream dissolves into that unbounded energy, which sees no separation and has no agenda or expectation, then suddenly that longing is embraced in that unconditional love that is no-ones.",

Those differences are valuable, they need not create any conflict, in fact they are the causes of attraction between them. If all the differences between men and women disappear, if they have the same kind of psychology, love will also disappear because the polarity will not be there. Man and woman are like negative and positive poles of electricity: they are pulled towards each other magnetically, they are opposite poles. Hence, conflict is natural. But through understanding, through compassion, through love, through looking into the other\u0027s world and trying to be sympathetic to it, all the problems can be solved. There is no need to create more conflict � enough is enough. Man needs as much liberation as woman. Both need liberation � liberation from the mind.

    "quotes": "There must be love in the relation between the person who says \u0027I am\u0027 and the observer of that \u0027I am\u0027. As long as the observer, the inner self, the higher self, considers himself apart from the observed, the lower self, despises it and condemns it, the situation is hopeless. It is only when the observer (vyakta) accepts the person (vyakti) as a projection or manifestation of himself and, so to say, takes the self into the Self, the duality of \u0027I\u0027 and \u0027this\u0027 goes, and in the identity of the outer and the inner the Supreme Reality manifests itself. This union of the seer and the seen happens when the seer becomes conscious of himself as the seer; he is not merely interested in the seen, which he is anyhow, but also interested in being interested, giving attention to attention, aware of being aware. Affectionate awareness is the crucial factor that brings Reality into focus. When the vyakti realizes its non-existence in separation from the vyakta, and the vyakta sees the vyakti as his own expression, then the peace and silence of the avyakta state come into being. In reality the three are one: the vyakta and the avyakta are inseparable, while the vyakti is the sensing-feeling-thinking process.",

    "quotes": "Love is a tremendous caring that arises in the wake of transcending the personal self. In the wake of this transcendence, something amazing arises. A deep love and caring arises from within emptiness, from nowhere. This love and caring seeks only the Truth in every moment and in all circumstances. True love is something far greater than anything that could be called personal. True love is a non-personal miracle. It is the nature of reality itself. It is the natural and spontaneous expression of the undivided Self.",

All those concepts of nothingness and absence and presence! Actually this is all about love. Love is the union of heart and mind. Nonduality isn\u0027t being detached from the world, being the witness of everything and taking part in nothing. It\u0027s not about sitting on your mountaintop and looking down at the world, pitying those poor mortals who aren\u0027t awakened as you are, those poor souls who still have egos! No, love cannot stand back from the world, because it IS the world. The heart of presence radiates love.",
