However, any level of awareness that you can go to with your mind, even if it is to a state of no mind, you must and will leave it again as the pull of identification with mind and body will demand further attention. Resting in the \u0027I am\u0027 is often referred to as a spiritual experience. Many  people come out of these experiences motivated by an eagerness to tell the story of what they experienced.

The \\I-thought\\ is the original personal thought and it is therefore mind itself. Placing your attention on the source of the \\I-thought\\ leads to something within you that is behind, prior to or beyond the mind. Ask the question \\From where does the I thought arise?\\ It is the source of all thoughts and, in trying to locate the source of the most intimate thought of \u0027I\u0027 you will find that it is no more than a concept. The source of all thought has no separate existence: a sense of nothingness leads you to Pure Self.",

It is limited and finite and its perception is determined by the conditions that are at play at the moment of perception. It has the ability to believe its own imaginings which include ideas about being able to grasp, own and control most things that come into its line of vision. If mind can create a concept, any concept, then it has material to work with and it readily believes that what is perceived is real. It can only deal with concepts and absolutely everything phenomenal rolls out from there. Prior to concept is also a concept and mind will project a meaning on that also. Prior to mind, beyond or outside of mind points to a \u0027zone\u0027 that does not hold concepts. This is where mind cannot go because mind itself is a concept. What is useful is to let mind know that it can\u0027t grasp what is beyond its capabilities � it can only work with that which can be reduced to concepts. Truth is only a concept when we talk about it, but in its essence it is prior to any concept. Like knowing that your car cannot fly up into the sky, mind is not wired to understand Truth and this needs to be known. Yet Truth can be known by some other capacity. Let this be accepted by mind, that there is a \u0027zone\u0027 beyond its reach. This piece of information stops mind from grasping and desiring Truth.",

Jac: The pointer that is suggested is to place attention where thoughts arise from. This suggests a sense of a place or even a blank image can arise for some - like a blank canvas before the picture appears on it. With Advaita it can be taken as a general guideline that when the mind asks \\how\\ it\u0027s nothing more than avoidance of following the lead that is suggested. One could just as easily be running any thought (e.g. \\I\u0027d love a coffee.\\) as running the \\how\\ thought. Asking how is simply running another thought and not following the suggestion. So it\u0027s not about finding out \\how\\, it\u0027s about following the lead regardless of what happens. You can\u0027t really get it wrong; it\u0027s the willingness to give it a go that is required. Then what happens, happens. The \\how\\ of it all, together with right and wrong outcomes can be ignored. We are stepping beyond such judgements when placing attention prior, from where thoughts arise.",
