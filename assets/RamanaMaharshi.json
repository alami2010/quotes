In other words, only after the first personal pronoun, \u0027I\u0027, has arisen, do the second and third personal pronouns (you, he, etc.) occur to the mind; and they cannot subsist without it. Since every other thought can occur only after the rise of the \u0027I-thought\u0027, and since the mind is nothing but a bundle of thoughts, it is only through the enquiry \u0027Who am I?\u0027 that the mind subsides. Moreover, the integral \u0027I-thought\u0027 implicit in such enquiry, having destroyed all other thoughts, itself finally gets destroyed or consumed, just as a stick used for stirring the burning funeral pyre gets consumed.",

But instead of setting about saying there is a mind and I want to kill it, you begin to seek its source, and then you find it does not exist at all. The mind turned outwards results in thoughts and objects. Turned inwards it becomes itself the Self. To ask the mind to kill the mind is like making the thief the policeman. He will go with you and pretend to catch the thief, but nothing will be gained. So, you must turn inward and see where the mind rises from and then it will cease to exist.",

The ego may take different and more subtle forms at different stages of one\u0027s practice but it is never destroyed. The attempt to destroy the ego or the mind by methods other than Self-enquiry is like a thief turning policeman to catch the thief that is himself.

This is the direct method. All other methods are practiced while retaining the ego and therefore many doubts arise and the ultimate question still remains to be tackled in the end. But in this method the final question is the only one and is raised from the very beginning. Self-enquiry leads directly to Self-realization by removing the obstacles which make you think that the Self is not already realized. Meditation requires an object to meditate on, whereas in Self-enquiry there is only the subject and no object. That is the difference between them.",

Know that the performance of the unceasing, true and natural worship in which the mind is submissively established as the one Self, having installed the Lord on the heart throne, is silence, the best of all forms of worship.

    "quotes": "It was in 1896, about 6 weeks before I left Madurai for good (to go to Tiruvannamalai-Arunachala) that this great change in my life took place. I was sitting alone in a room on the first floor of my uncle\u0027s house. I seldom had any sickness and on that day there was nothing wrong with my health, but a sudden violent fear of death overtook me. There was nothing in my state of health to account for it nor was there any urge in me to find out whether there was any account for the fear. I just felt I was going to die and began thinking what to do about it. It did not occur to me to consult a doctor or any elders or friends. I felt I had to solve the problem myself then and there. The shock of the fear of death drove my mind inwards and I said to myself mentally, without actually framing the words: \u0027Now death has come; what does it mean? What is it that is dying? This body dies.\u0027 And at once I dramatised the occurrence of death. I lay with my limbs stretched out still as though rigor mortis has set in, and imitated a corpse so as to give greater reality to the enquiry. I held my breath and kept my lips tightly closed so that no sound could escape, and that neither the word \u0027I\u0027 nor any word could be uttered. \u0027Well then,\u0027 I said to myself, \u0027this body is dead. It will be carried stiff to the burning ground and there burn and reduced to ashes. But with the death of the body, am I dead? Is the body I? It is silent and inert, but I feel the full force of my personality and even the voice of I within me, apart from it. So I am the Spirit transcending the body. The body dies but the spirit transcending it cannot be touched by death. That means I am the deathless Spirit.\u0027 All this was not dull thought; it flashed through me vividly as living truths which I perceived directly almost without thought process. I was something real, the only real thing about my present state, and all the conscious activity connected with the body was centered on that \u0027I\u0027. From that moment onwards, the \u0027I\u0027 or Self focused attention on itself by a powerful fascination. Fear of death vanished once and for all. The ego was lost in the flood of Self-awareness. Absorption in the Self continued unbroken from that time. Other thought might come and go like the various notes of music, but the I continued like the fundamental sruti note [\u0027that which is heard\u0027] a note which underlies and blends with all other notes.",

If we can attain it or be in that state, it is all right. But one cannot reach it without effort, the effort of deliberate meditation. All the age-long vasanas carry the mind outward and turn it to external objects. All such thoughts have to be given up and the mind turned inward. For that, effort is necessary for most people. Of course everybody, every book says: \\Summa iru\\ (\\Be quiet or still\\). But it is not easy. That is why all this effort is necessary. Even if we find one who has at once achieved the mauna or Supreme state indicated by \\Summa iru\\, you may take it that the effort necessary has already been finished in a previous life. So that, effortless and choiceless awareness is reached only after deliberate meditation. That meditation can take any form which appeals to you best.

All that is needed is that you give up your realisation of the not-true as true. All of us are regarding as real that which is not real. We have only to give up this practice on our part. Then we shall realise the Self as the Self; in other words, \\Be the Self\\. At one stage you will laugh at yourself for trying to discover the Self which is so self-evident.

Bhagavan replied: When we have vikalpas and are trying to give them up, i.e., when we are still not perfected, but have to make conscious effort to keep the mind one-pointed or free from thought it is nirvikalpa samadhi. When through practice we are always in that state, not going into samadhi and coming out again, that is the sahaja state. In sahaja one sees always oneself. He sees the jagat as swarupa or brahmakara. What is once the means becomes itself the goal, eventually, whatever method one follows, dhyana, jnana or bhakti.

Take the instance of moving pictures on the screen in the cinema show. What is there in front of you before the play begins ? Merely the screen. On that screen you see the entire show, and for all appearances the pictures are real. But go and try to take hold of them. What do you take hold of ? Merely the screen on which the pictures appeared. After the play, when the pictures disappear, what remains ? The screen again. So with the Self. That alone exists, the pictures come and go. If you hold on to the Self, you will not be deceived by the appearance of the pictures. Nor does it matter at all if the pictures appear or disappear. Ignoring the Self the ajnani thinks the world is real, just as ignoring the screen he sees merely the pictures, as if they existed apart from it. If one knows that without the seer there is nothing to be seen, just as there are no pictures without the screen, one is not deluded. The jnani knows that the screern and its pictures are only the Self. With the pictures the Self is in its manifest form; without the pictures it remains in the unmanifest form. To the jnani it is quite immaterial if the Self is in one form or the other. He is always the Self. But the ajnani seeing the jnani active gets confounded.",

It consists in turning the mind inwards to the sense of being, the feeling of \u0027I am\u0027. The purpose of enquiry is to make one aware of being at will and for longer and longer periods. In enquiry there is only the subject. You are not looking for anything new, anything outside yourself, but simply concentrating or paying attention on being, on your self, on the pure \u0027I am\u0027 in you. It is not thinking but suspending thought while retaining consciousness. The only way is persistence. Constant alertness... Not to get carried away by thoughts. To see them aloofly like clouds passing over a clear sky and ask, \\What is this thought? Who did it come to? To me, but who am I?\\ And so you bring your mind back to enquiry. ",

When one persistently inquires into the nature of the mind, the mind will end leaving the Self (as the residue). What is referred to as the Self is the Atman.

    "quotes": "Q: You say one can realize the Self by a search for it. What is the character of this search? A: You are the mind or think that you are the mind. The mind is nothing but thoughts. Now behind every particular thought there is a general thought, which is the \u0027I\u0027, that is yourself. Let us call this \u0027I\u0027 the first thought. Stick to this \u0027I\u0027-thought and question it to find out what it is. When this question takes strong hold on you, you cannot think of other thoughts. Q: When I do this and cling to my self, that is, the \u0027I\u0027-thought, other thoughts come and go, but I say to myself \u0027Who am I?\u0027 and there is no answer forthcoming. To be in this condition is the practice. Is it so? A: This is a mistake that people often make. What happens when you make a serious quest for the Self is that the \u0027I\u0027-thought disappears and something else from the depths takes hold of you and that is not the \u0027I\u0027 which commenced the quest. Q: What is this something else? A: That is the real Self, the import of \u0027I\u0027. It is not the ego. It is the Supreme Being itself. Q: But you have often said that one must reject other thoughts when one begins the quest but the thoughts are endless. If one thought is rejected, another comes and there seems to be no end at all. A: I do not say that you must go on rejecting thoughts. Cling to yourself, that is, to the \u0027I\u0027-thought. When your interest keeps you to that single idea, other thoughts will automatically get rejected and they will vanish. Q: And so rejection of thoughts is not necessary? A: No. It may be necessary for a time or for some. You fancy that there is no end if one goes on rejecting every thought when it rises. It is not true, there is an end. If you are vigilant and make a stern effort to reject every thought when it rises you will soon find that you are going deeper and deeper into your own inner self. At that level it is not necessary to make an effort to reject thoughts. Q: Then it is possible to be without effort, without strain. A: Not only that, it is impossible for you to make an effort beyond a certain extent. Q: I want to be further enlightened. Should I try to make no effort at all? A: Here it is impossible for you to be without effort. When you go deeper, it is impossible for you to make any effort. If the mind becomes introverted through enquiry into the source of aham-vritti, the vasanas become extinct. The light of the Self falls on the vasanas and produces the phenomenon of reflection we call the mind. Thus, when the vasanas become extinct the mind also disappears, being absorbed into the light of the one reality, the Heart. This is the sum and substance of all that an aspirant needs to know. What is imperatively required of him is an earnest and one-pointed enquiry into the source of the aham-vritti.",

Hold on to one thought so that others are expelled. Continuous practice gives the necessary strength of mind to engage in meditation. Meditation differs according to the degree of advancement of the seeker. If one is fit for it one can hold directly to the thinker; and the thinker will automatically sink into his source, which is Pure Consciousness. If one cannot directly hold on to the thinker, one must meditate on God; and in due course the same individual will have become sufficiently pure to hold on to the thinker and sink into the absolute Being.",

With your consciousness hold fast to and never abandon the substratum, your real nature, the Supreme that can neither be held nor relinquished. Is the Self something far away that you have to touch? The higher Self exists as one but it is only your thoughts that make you feel it is not. You can neither think about it nor forget it. Other than the thought of the Self, any other thought you ay associate with, is a mere mental construct, foreign to that Self. Thinking of the Self is to abide as that tranquil consciousness. Padam, the true swarupa, can neither be remembered nor forgotten. The Self is self-luminous without darkness and light, and is the reality which is self-manifest. Therefore, one should not think of it as this or that. All such thoughts would only end in bondage. The purport of meditation on the Self is to make the mind take the \u0027form\u0027 of the Self. In the middle of the heart-cave is the pure Brahman directly manifest as the Self in the form of \u0027I-I\u0027.

This \u0027I am\u0027, we know, is real, because it is the part that is constant and unchanging. We need to reject the unreal part, the sheaths or bodies, and take the remainder, the pure \u0027I am\u0027. This \u0027I am\u0027 is a clue to the finding of the real Self. By holding on to this clue, the Sage tells us, we can surely find the Self. He once compared the seeker of the Self to a dog seeking his master, from whom he had been parted. The dog has something to guide him, namely the master\u0027s scent. By following the scent, leaving everything else, he ultimately finds his master. The \u0027I am\u0027 in the ego-sense is just like the master\u0027s scent for the dog. It is the only clue the seeker has for finding the Self. But it is an infallible clue. He must get and keep hold of it, fix his mind on it to the exclusion of all other things. It will then surely take his mind to the Self, the source of the \u0027I am\u0027.",

Then you take up this or that sadhana (practice) to transcend the nonexistent limitations. But if your sadhana (practice) itself assumes the existence of the limitations, how can it help you to transcend them? Hence I say know that you are really the infinite, pure Being, the Self Absolute. You are always that Self and nothing but that Self. Therefore, you can never be really ignorant of the Self; your ignorance is merely a formal ignorance. Know then that true Knowledge does not create a new Being for you; it only removes your \\ignorant ignorance\\. Bliss is not added to your nature; it is merely revealed as your true and natural state, eternal and imperishable. The only way to be rid of your grief is to know and be the Self.",

In all books on vedanta you will find this question of a void or of nothing being left, raised by the disciple and answered by the Guru. It is the mind that sees objects and has experiences and that finds a void when it ceases to see experience, but that is not you. You are the constant illumination that lights up both the experiences and the void. It is like the theatre light that enables you to see the theatre, the actors and the play while the play is going on but also remains alight and enables you to say that there is no play on when it is all finished. Or there is another illustration. We see objects all around us, but in complete darkness we do not see them and we say, I see nothing, even then the eyes are there to say that they see nothing.

    "quotes": "Commentary by David Godman: Ramana Maharshi never advised his devotees to practise Kundalini Yoga since he regarded it as being both potentially dangerous and unnecessary. He accepted the existence of the Kundalini power and the Chakras but he said that even if the Kundalini reached the Sahsrara it would not result in realisation. For final realisation, he said, the Kundalini must go beyond the Sahasrara, down another Nadi (psychic nerve) he called Amritanadi (also called the Paranadi or Jivanadi) and into the Heart-centre on the right hand side of the chest. Since he maintained that self-enquiry would automatically send the Kundalini to the Heart-centre, he taught that separate yoga exercises were unnecessary. The practitioners of Kundalini Yoga concentrate on psychic centres (Chakras) in the body in order to generate a spiritual power they call Kundalini. The aim of this practice is to force the Kundalini up the psychic channel (the Sushumna) which runs from the base of the spine to the brain. The Kundalini Yogi believes that when this power reaches the Sahasrara (the highest Chakra located in the brain), Self-realisation will result. Ramana Maharshi taught that the Self is reached by the search for the origin of the ego and by diving into the Heart. This is the direct method of Self-realisation. One who adopts it need not worry about Nadis, the brain centre (Sahasrara), the Sushumna, the Paranadi, the Kundalini, Pranayama or the six centres (Chakras).",

Padam, the true swarupa, can neither be remembered nor forgotten. The Self is self-luminous without darkness and light, and is the reality which is self-manifest. Therefore, one should not think of it as this or that. All such thoughts would only end in bondage. The purport of meditation on the Self is to make the mind take the \u0027form\u0027 of the Self.

One must, therefore, watch one�s spiritual progress carefully. One must not allow oneself to be overtaken by such spells of stillness of thought: the moment one experiences this, one must revive consciousness and enquire within as to who it is who experiences this stillness. While not allowing any thoughts to intrude, he must not, at the same time, be overtaken by this deep sleep (Yoga nidra) or Self-hypnotism. Though this is a sign of progress towards the goal, yet it is also the point where the divergence between the road to salvation and Yoga nidra takes place. The easy way, the direct way, the shortest cut to salvation is the Enquiry method. By such enquiry, you will drive the thought force deeper till it reaches its source and merges therein.
